    "title": "Barcelona vs Real Madrid: Ancelotti coy on future as Alonso link grows",
    "text": "Carlo Ancelotti says Xabi Alonso has “all the doors open” for a move to a big club, with speculation building that the former Real Madrid midfielder is set to replace the Italian coach at the helm of the Spanish powerhouse.\nAncelotti gave his routine pre-game news conference on Saturday, a day after Alonso announced he was leaving Bayer Leverkusen.\nHe praised the work of Alonso, who has been widely linked to an eventual move back to Madrid after leading the German club to the Bundesliga title last season.\n“I read that Xabi is leaving Bayer Leverkusen, where he did a fantastic job,” Ancelotti said before Sunday’s trip to Barcelona. “He has all the doors open because he has shown that he is one of the best coaches in the world.”\nAncelotti again refused to speak about his future, especially before a decisive Clasico in LaLiga. Madrid trail Barcelona by four points and need to win to keep alive their chances of winning a trophy this campaign.\nBut he did speak movingly about what Madrid means — and will mean — for the most successful manager in European football.\nFor Ancelotti, his relationship with the club he has spent six seasons at in two stints is an everlasting “honeymoon”.\n“The honeymoon with this club never ends, it continues forever,” he said. “I think that Real Madrid, like Milan before, are the teams that stay with me, given the time I have spent here. At the beginning, there is passion, and when that fades, other feelings emerge, a sense of tender care. My honeymoon with Real Madrid will last for as long as I live.”\nThe 65-year-old coach is under contract through the next campaign but is widely expected to leave after an underwhelming season in which the team played worse despite adding Kylian Mbappe to its squad.\nBrazil have been courting Ancelotti for over a year, and it appears talks are still ongoing with the veteran manager.\nReal Madrid must play ‘complete’ game at Barcelona\nWith only four games remaining of the LaLiga season, only a win will realistically keep Real’s hopes of retaining the title, and for Ancelotti, they will need to get everything right to have a chance on Sunday.\n“In this type of game, you have to do things well. Barcelona are used to keeping the opponent in their own area, but no team is perfect,” he said.\n“It’s a game where there’s a lot at stake, and to win, you have to manage everything well, defend well, attack well. We have to play a complete game.”\nWith so much at stake against their great rivals, Ancelotti will have little trouble getting his players fired up.\n“It’s not difficult to motivate the players because it’s the type of match for which the players already come out motivated and with a lot of confidence,” he said.\n“Playing with Barcelona is special. It will be the last ‘El Clasico’ of the season because Barca are not in the Club World Cup.”\nBarcelona focused despite Champions League woe\nBarcelona’s players have discussed last week’s Champions League elimination and are ready to put their disappointment behind them against rivals Real Madrid, manager Hansi Flick said in his news conference on Saturday.\nBarca suffered a 4-3 Champions League semifinal defeat by Inter Milan on Tuesday.\nA home win on Sunday would move Flick’s side one victory away from their 28th Spanish league title.\n“We’re doing well. After the defeat in Milan, everyone knows it’s not easy … but we’re doing things right. We’ve talked about what we want to do in these two weeks,” Flick told reporters.\n“There are four more games to go. El Clasico is important, we have to show how well we can play. We have to show confidence. The players are doing very well … We’ve been talking about what they are thinking, what they are feeling.\n“We had to talk about it as a group. Everyone knows that in a Clasico, you have to give 100 percent. You have to be active, intense, dominant. Real Madrid is a very good team, and we need the fans.”\nEl Clasico – the low down\nTranslated as “The Classic” in English, El Clasico is the name given to any football match between rival clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid.\nThe special matchup between these football sides was born out of a more-than-a-century-old political-historical dimension between an increasingly distinct Catalan national identity, with FC Barcelona representing Catalonia, pitched against the centralised power structures of Spain’s capital city, Madrid, and by extension, its most famous football club, Real Madrid.\nThe first match between the two Spanish mega clubs was played on May 13, 1902.\nIn total, 260 matches have been played. Real Madrid lead in head-to-head results with 105 wins to Barcelona’s 103, with 52 draws.\nLast five LaLiga matches\nBarcelona: W-W-W-W-D (most recent fixture first)\nMay 3, 2025 – Real Valladolid 1-2 Barcelona\nApril 22, 2025 – Barcelona 1-0 Mallorca\nApril 19, 2025 – Barcelona 4-3 Celta Vigo\nApril 12, 2025 – Leganes 0-1 Barcelona\nApril 5, 2025 – Barcelona 1-1 Real Betis\nReal Madrid: W-W-W-W-L (most recent fixture first)",

    "title": "Iran’s FM visits Saudi Arabia, Qatar before nuclear talks with US in Oman",
    "text": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar for consultations in the run-up to the fourth round of indirect nuclear talks with the United States, which will take place in Oman on Sunday.\nThe future direction of Iran’s nuclear programme, its enrichment of uranium, and sanctions relief remain the key issues.\nSpeaking later Saturday in Doha, Araghchi said that if the US’s goal is to deprive Iran of its nuclear rights, Tehran will not back down from “any of our rights”.\nIran insists its programme is for civilian purposes and it has no intention to pursue a nuclear weapon.\nAraghchi told Al Jazeera in Doha, “I have always said that if the… purpose of a deal is to …ensure that Iran would never have [a] nuclear weapon that is already granted… and a deal would be at our reach”.\n“But if there are unrealistic…demands by the other side, then we are going to have problems”, he said.\nIn an interview with Breitbart News on Friday, President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who will attend the talks in Oman, said the US would “take [Iran] at their word” that they do not want nuclear weapons, but set out specific conditions for verifying such a position.”\n“If that’s how they feel, then their enrichment facilities have to be dismantled. They cannot have centrifuges. They have to downblend all of their fuel that they have there and send it to a faraway place — and they have to convert to a civil programme if they want to run a civil programme,” he said.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has raised the possibility of Iran importing enriched uranium for any civilian energy.\nAraqhchi’s Gulf tour on Saturday came after Tehran confirmed the latest round Friday: “The negotiations are moving forward, and naturally, the further we go, the more consultations and reviews are needed,” Araghchi said in remarks carried by Iranian state media.\nOmani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said on Friday that, after “coordination with both Iran and the US”, the delayed talks would go ahead in Muscat. The fourth round, initially scheduled for May 3 in Rome, was postponed for what Oman described as “logistical reasons”.\nOngoing dispute over nuclear programme\nThe talks come against the backdrop of a long-running dispute over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The meeting is the latest effort to revive diplomacy after years of rising tensions.\nSuccessive US administrations have sought to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. A sustained effort by world powers during the Barack Obama administration culminated in a 2015 agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\nThe multilateral agreement created a framework for Iran to receive much-needed relief from international sanctions, in exchange for reducing its uranium enrichment and submitting to inspections of its nuclear facilities.\nBut when Trump succeeded Obama as US president, he unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear agreement in 2018, causing the deal to crumble.\nSome Western countries argue that Iran’s programme, accelerated after the US walkout from the 2015 accord, is aimed at developing weapons. Tehran maintains that its nuclear activity is entirely civilian.\nTrump himself has acknowledged tensions in his policy on Iran, saying at the start of his second term that hawkish advisors were pushing him to step up pressure reluctantly.\nIn an interview on Thursday, Trump said he wanted “total verification” that Iran’s contested nuclear work is shut down, but through diplomacy.\n“I’d much rather make a deal” than see military action, Trump told the conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt.\n“There are only two alternatives – blow ’em up nicely or blow ’em up viciously,” Trump said.\nIran’s Gulf outreach\nAraqchi’s trips to Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Saturday are part of what he describes as “continuous consultations” with neighbouring states.\nHe said the visits aimed to address “concerns and mutual interests” regarding the nuclear issue.\nAraghchi told Al Jazeera on Saturday that Iran is regularly in contact with Saudi Arabia, but the purpose of this visit was “to consult with our Saudi colleagues, especially on Iran-US talks”.\n“We want to make sure that you know everybody’s on board, and there would be no concern …So I hope that when we come to a deal”, he said.\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei confirmed the presence of a technical delegation in the talks in Oman on Saturday.\nIn an interview with Mehr News, Baghaei stated that the Iranian delegation is comprised of experts and specialists relevant to the current phase of the negotiations. He did not comment on the US team.",

    "title": "‘Difficult ceasefire’: Guns silent, but will the India-Pakistan truce hold?",
    "text": "New Delhi, India – Mukeet Shah had not slept for days, doomscrolling on his mobile phone as he remained hooked to news updates on the spiralling India-Pakistan conflict.\nA phone call from his mother, Tanveera Bano, on Saturday made it worse. “Please, come back [home]. Why be apart when we can at least die together?” she urged her younger son, who studies at a university in New Delhi, the national capital.\nShah, 23, said her appeal shattered him. An hour or so later, another news flash popped up on his phone: “US President Donald Trump says India and Pakistan have agreed to a ‘full and immediate’ ceasefire.” Moments later, the South Asian rivals confirmed the ceasefire, mediated by dozens of countries besides the United States.\n“It was such a relief,” Shah recalled. Happily, he called home. “Both countries have agreed to peace. We will spend more time soon, don’t be afraid, mother,” he told 48-year-old Bano, who asked him to focus on his studies and return home only after his annual exams.\nHowever, barely three hours after that phone call, the sense of relief was blown away. A barrage of drones had hit Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir, forcing another electricity blackout. Similar reports of firings and drone sightings came from other cities in the region, including Jammu, Anantnag, as well as the border districts of Rajasthan and Gujarat states.\nOn the Pakistan side as well, several villages along the Line of Control (LoC) – the de facto border that divides Kashmir – reported alleged ceasefire violations by the Indian forces. As Pakistan and India denied each other’s allegations and reaffirmed their commitment to the ceasefire, questions were raised on whether the fragile agreement between the nuclear-powered neighbours would hold.\nBano called her son again, crying.\n“In her intermittent pauses, I could hear sounds of blasts behind her as she broke down. The jets were loud as well,” Shah told Al Jazeera on Saturday night, sitting in a huddle with his Kashmiri friends in a New Delhi neighbourhood, 800km (about 500 miles) away from home.\nEighteen days after gunmen killed 26 civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir’s resort town of Pahalgam, nearly 1.6 billion people on either side of the border reeled under the fears of another India-Pakistan war over Kashmir, a Muslim-majority Himalayan region claimed in full by both the nations that rule over parts of it.\nAn armed rebellion against New Delhi’s rule erupted on the Indian side in 1989. Since then, tens of thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been killed in the conflict. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of backing the rebellion, but Pakistan denies the allegation and claims to provide only diplomatic support to the Kashmiris’ struggle for an independent state or a likely merger with Pakistan.\n‘Kashmiris stuck in the middle’\nAbbas, a Srinagar resident who requested to be identified by his last name only, told Al Jazeera the loud explosions his family heard on Saturday night were terrifying.\n“Each blast came out of nowhere and left us scared and confused. As a Kashmiri, I have lived through tough times before, but this [current conflict] feels different,” he said.\nAbbas said he had been waking up to toddlers crying amid explosions at night.\n“It feels like a psychological war has been waged on us. The fear isn’t just from the blasts; it is from the uncertainty and a lack of transparency,” he said. “Kashmiris are once again stuck in the middle, with no refuge, no escape.”\nYet, the ceasefire announcement on Saturday evening was met with jubilation in several frontier districts on the Indian side, especially among thousands of displaced residents since the cross-border tensions mounted earlier this month.\nDeepak Singh, a 40-year-old resident of Poonch, one of the most affected border districts in Indian-administered Kashmir, said in a brief phone interview that his family of four looked forward to leaving their shelter and being home.\n“We have known a life that gets disturbed by the border clashes, but I am hopeful to return to my home soon,” Singh told Al Jazeera.\nBut that was before the explosions were reported from Srinagar. As both sides accused each other of breaching the truce, Singh said he felt devastated.\n“Not again,” he later said. “Till how long are we supposed to sleep in this shelter? Will this ceasefire hold at all?”\nMore than 1,000km (620 miles) away, Pradyot Verma was having similar feelings.\nA resident of Jodhpur, a border town in India’s western state of Rajasthan, Verma said their joy and relief were short-lived as they witnessed another round of blackouts and siren alerts on Saturday night, keeping the residents in an anxious loop.\n“The ceasefire announcement was met with cheers here,” said the 26-year-old law student as he sat in darkness in his rented room. “Indian defence system keeps on intercepting [Pakistan-origin missiles] and we are hoping that they keep doing it.”\n‘Back from the brink of war’\nAfter four days of military escalation, during which Indian and Pakistani forces attacked each other’s military installations, they agreed on a ceasefire, which Trump said was reached after “a long night of talks” mediated by the US and other countries. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the two nations have also agreed to “start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site”.\nHowever, geopolitical and military experts argue the ceasefire is fragile and does not promise much.\n“The Indian government has already signalled rebutting Rubio’s assertion that India and Pakistan have agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Sumantra Bose, a political scientist, told Al Jazeera. “It is something [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s government just can’t do, given its commitment to unilateralism on Kashmir and rejection of diplomatic engagement with Pakistan.”\nBose said the ceasefire was merely a “band-aid slapped on a profusely bleeding wound that was threatening to turn gangrenous if not fatal”.\nWhile the escalation might have stopped due to intervention by foreign governments, “the problem is all the other parameters and vectors of the India-Pakistan relationship and the Kashmir conflict remain as before”, Bose said, adding, “in an even more bitter and toxic form than was the case earlier”.\nHowever, Michael Kugelman, an expert on South Asia politics, stressed that the subcontinent was “back from the brink of war”.\n“This ceasefire, so long as it holds, even with some violations, does bring an end to what had been the biggest regional security threat by far in decades,” he told Al Jazeera.\n“This is going to be a very difficult ceasefire to uphold. It was very quickly put together at a moment when India-Pakistan tensions were soaring [and] this is also a ceasefire that appears to have been interpreted differently by India,” added Kugelman, referring to India’s historic position on Kashmir, which has been a consistent rejection of any attempt by Pakistan at internationalising the issue.\nBut for the people living along the tense borders between the South Asian rivals, a cautious optimism is their only recourse.\n“We are holding this ceasefire very dear to us,” said a Kashmiri political analyst, who requested anonymity, fearing reprisal from the Indian authorities.\n“Be it anyone’s war, India or Pakistan, people on the border, Kashmiris and Punjabis, have been losing their lives for generations. I hope this madness stops here.”",

    "title": "India and Pakistan agree ceasefire: What does it mean?",
    "text": "India and Pakistan have reached a ceasefire agreement following a brief period of hostilities over the past few days, United States President Donald Trump announced on Saturday.\nEarlier on Saturday, the two neighbours targeted each other’s military sites as Pakistan launched “Operation Bunyan Marsoos” after three of its own airbases were hit by India’s air-to-surface missiles. Both sides claimed to have intercepted most projectiles, but also admitted that some strikes caused damage.\nMore than 60 people have been reported killed since India launched missiles under “Operation Sindoor” on Wednesday, which it said targeted “terrorist camps” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has confirmed the killing of 13 people on its side of the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between the two countries dividing the disputed Kashmir region.\nThe strikes had raised fears of a wider conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. While international mediation has resolved disputes between India and Pakistan before, it remains to be seen if this ceasefire will hold and whether people will be able to relax.\nWhat has been agreed upon by India and Pakistan?\n“After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.\n“Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Multiple countries are understood to have been involved in these talks.\nPakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed the ceasefire shortly after.\n“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all fighting and military action on land, air and sea with effect from 17:00 Indian Standard Time today [11:30 GMT],” Misri said in a short statement.\n“Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding. The directors general of military operations will talk again on May 12 at 12:00.”\nIndia and Pakistan have also activated military channels and hotlines following the deal, according to Dar.\nWill the two countries engage in further talks now?\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a “broad set of issues at a neutral site”.\nHowever, in a statement on social media, India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting partially denied this, stating: “There is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.”\nSubir Sinha, director of the South Asian Institute at SOAS University of London, told Al Jazeera that broader bilateral talks would be a very challenging process as India had previously rejected such a development.\n“One of the arguments about this so-called robust policy towards Pakistan that Modi’s government had adopted was that it was no longer possible to sit down and discuss a broad and long-term commitment to resolve issues,” Sinha said.\nTherefore, this would mark a reversal of the Indian government’s position and could play out poorly with the right wing in India, whose members have been calling for an attack on Pakistan.\nSinha said both the Indus Waters Treaty, which India suspended its participation of and the Simla Agreement, which Pakistan threatened to pull out of, will need to be fully resumed and “to be looked [at] perhaps as bases for moving forward”.\nWere India and Pakistan actually at war?\nOfficially, no. Despite intense military exchanges, including missile strikes, drone attacks, and artillery shelling, neither government made an official declaration of war.\nIndia and Pakistan instead characterised their military actions as specific coordinated “military operations”.\nPakistan on Saturday launched a retaliatory assault it named “Bunyan Marsoos”, Arabic for “Wall of Lead”, just days after India initiated “Operation Sindoor“, responding to a deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam on April 22, which it blamed on Pakistan-based armed groups.\nHowever, that is not unusual for these two countries. They have not officially declared war in previous major conflicts, even as thousands of soldiers and civilians died.\nHas third-party intervention solved disputes between India and Pakistan before?\nYes. Third-party mediation has resolved disputes since 1947, when the subcontinent split through partition and India and Pakistan fought their first war. After a yearlong war over ownership of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, a United Nations-brokered ceasefire effectively split Kashmir between Indian- and Pakistan-administered regions in 1948.\nThe 1965 Indo-Pakistani War ended with the Tashkent Declaration in January 1966, following mediation by the erstwhile Soviet Union. The accord saw Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan agree to pull back to pre-war positions and restore diplomatic and economic ties.\nDuring the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistani troops crossed the LoC and seized Indian positions. Then-US President Bill Clinton convinced Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw, warning of international isolation.\nIn 2002, then-US Secretary of State Colin Powell claimed he and his team had mediated the end of a tense stand-off along the LoC following an attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001. The following June, Powell said that through negotiations, he had received assurances from President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan that “infiltration activity” across the LoC would cease and that armed groups would be dismantled on Pakistani territory.\nWhat constitutes a war?\nThere is no single definition. International humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Conventions, uses the term “international armed conflict” instead of “war”, defining it more broadly as any use of armed forces between states, regardless of whether either side calls it a “war”.\nIn modern international law, all uses of force are categorised as “armed conflict” regardless of justifications such as self-defence, according to Ahmer Bilal Soofi, an advocate in the Supreme Court of Pakistan who also specialises in international law.\nThe suspension of a treaty can also signal the start of war, he added. India suspended its participation in the landmark Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan on April 23, a move Pakistan described as a “hostile act”.\n“Political scientists normally say a war only exists after fighting becomes quite intense – normally 1,000 battle deaths,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany. “For governments, though, wars exist whenever they say so.”\nExperts argue the recent escalation in military actions by India and Pakistan was as much about signalling strength as they were about military objectives, and was also part of a broader effort to manage domestic and international perception.\nSean Bell, a United Kingdom-based military analyst, said much of the current rhetoric from both India and Pakistan is deliberately aimed at domestic audiences. Each side is “trying to make clear to their own populations that there is a robust military response, and that they’re retaliating for any actions”, he told Al Jazeera. But this tit-for-tat dynamic, Bell warned, risks becoming difficult to stop once it starts.\nWhy are countries reluctant to formally announce a war?\nFollowing the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945, “no country claims ‘war’ or declares ‘war’ as, legally speaking, it is viewed as unlawful use of force”, Soofi told Al Jazeera.\nOfficially, being in a state of armed conflict triggers international legal obligations, such as following the rules of armed conflict and being accountable for war crimes.\nIn the latest India-Pakistan standoff, both sides portrayed the other as the aggressor, insisting it should be the one to de-escalate.\nThe absence of a formal, universally accepted definition of war means countries can engage in sustained military operations without ever officially declaring war. Ambiguity also allows governments to frame military actions in ways that suit their political or diplomatic goals.\nFor example, Russia has consistently described its 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation”, despite large-scale troop deployments, air strikes and territorial occupation. Similarly, the US referred to the Korean War in the 1950s as a “police action” and framed its long-term activities in Afghanistan and Iraq as “counterterrorism operations”. Israel also often uses terms like “military campaign” or “operation” for cross-border offensives, such as “Operation Protective Edge” during its 2014 war in Gaza.",

    "title": "Putin's talks offer could be bid to drive wedge between US and Europe",
    "text": "Putin's offer of talks may be attempt to divide the US and Europe\n35 minutes ago\nSteve Rosenberg\nRussia Editor\nReporting from Moscow\nWe've seen it before: Vladimir Putin doesn't react well to ultimatums. We saw it again, last night, in the Kremlin.\nPresident Putin slammed European powers for talking to Russia \"in a boorish manner and with the help of ultimatums\".\nHe didn't go into detail. He didn't need to.\nThis was clearly his response to the ultimatum set by European leaders in Kyiv.\nThey had warned Moscow that if Russia didn't agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from Monday, there will be more sanctions against Russia and more military assistance for Ukraine.\nOn Saturday, Sir Keir Starmer said that \"if he [Putin] is serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it\".\nThe Kremlin's response: we're serious, but we'll show it our way.\nPutin's way (his counter proposal) is direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul next Thursday.\nBut, crucially, no immediate ceasefire.\nSo, is the Kremlin's offer a serious peace initiative? Or is it simply an attempt by Moscow to play for time and to prolong the war? And, with this proposal, might Russia also be trying to split the Western coalition that is backing Ukraine?\nLet's begin with a short, but key question: does Vladimir Putin want peace?\nHe claims he does. But peace only on Russia's terms.\nMoscow suspects it has little to gain from a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, especially since the Russians believe they currently have the initiative on the battlefield in Ukraine.\nBut neither does Russia want to be seen as an obstacle to peace. It's keen to maintain a good relationship with the Donald Trump administration, with which the Kremlin has been working hard on improving ties.\nIf a US-Russia rapprochement continues, the Kremlin will be hoping for speedy sanctions relief and an economic boost.\nBy proposing direct talks in Istanbul, President Putin is sending a signal to the White House: \"I am a man of peace.\"\nBut by not committing to an immediate 30-day ceasefire, the likelihood is Russia will continue the war, and push on to seize and occupy more Ukrainian territory.\nThe Kremlin leader's vague reference to \"not excluding\" that the Istanbul talks might lead to \"new ceasefires\" will be greeted with deep scepticism by Kyiv.\nAnd when we're talking about war and peace, keep in mind that it was President Putin who ordered the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nThis was his decision, one widely seen as an attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit.\nHe didn't call it a war, though. He portrayed Russia's actions as a \"special military operation\".\nLast night, though, Putin declared: \"There is ongoing fighting, war. But we're offering to resume talks that were interrupted, and not by us. What's bad about that?\"\nThe Kremlin may well be calculating that its offer of direct talks in Istanbul will drive a wedge between the US administration and European leaders.\nFollowing Putin's announcement, President Trump hailed a \"potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine\" in a social media post, and promised to \"continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens\".",

    "title": "Bedford \"professional cuddler\" spreads word on benefits of touch",
    "text": "'I'm a professional cuddler - let me tell you why a hug feels so good'\n11 hours ago\nDanny Fullbrook\nBBC News, Bedfordshire\nEvery fortnight, Samii Wood snuggles up with a group of strangers for a \"cuddle puddle\".\nThese gatherings see attendees melt into a large nest of cushions and blankets, offering each other platonic touch and comfort.\nSamii, who is 41 and based in Bedford, is a professional cuddler, who also offers one-to-one cuddle therapy.\nShe believes human touch is not just comforting but also has measurable health benefits.\n\"Your serotonin levels, which is your feel-good hormone, are boosted and so is your oxytocin level, which is your love and bonding hormone,\" she says.\nTouch can also lower your levels of stress hormone cortisol and \"can regulate the nervous system\", she adds.\nSamii's clients are sometimes suffering with nervous system issues, post-traumatic stress disorder or loneliness.\n\"People think that my service will be just full of creepy guys,\" she says.\n\"It's not like that. I have a variety of ages and males and females that come to these events.\"\nPep Valerio, 36, from Bedford, has been attending Samii's cuddle puddles for a couple of months.\n\"It's healing without words. You don't need to know people's problems; you just know your touch is providing aid to them,\" he said.\nSamii describes how in group sessions, attendees are told to imagine certain scenarios to give specific emotional context.\n\"Sometimes I say, 'Imagine the person you're hugging is the person you'd most like to hug just one more time',\" she adds.\n\"That always chokes me up, and and we've had men and women both literally just sobbing on each other.\"\nOne-to-one sessions are catered more towards an individual's needs.\nThey can range from simply sitting close together and talking with an arm around them, to lying down and spooning.\nIt can also involve other nurturing touch, such as back stroking or cradling.\nSome might raise an eyebrow at the thought that people are paying for this, but Sammi stresses it is a \"fully clothed, platonic, nurturing service\".\nTo safeguard all involved, she screens clients before taking them on and gets them to sign consent forms that explicitly state boundaries.\n\"It's very client-led, so they tell me what they want and what they're comfortable with. It's an ongoing dialogue,\" Samii says.\nShe acknowledges that intimate touch can lead to arousal, but in those cases she enforces a break or change of position to refocus clients on the nurturing aspect of the session.\nThere is no regulatory body in the UK for this type of therapy, but professionals like Samii can gain accreditation from Cuddle Professionals International (CPI).\nThis body insists its members are taught to observe \"ethical touch protocols\" that rely on informed consent.\nWhile many practices may uphold professional standards, it is potentially an easy environment to misuse and exploit.\nSamii says people can report any wrongdoing to the police, local authority or CPI.\nThe body was founded by wellness expert Claire Mendelsohn, who according to her website, \"recognised the need for regulation within the profession\".\nCPI is now a registered college with the Complementary Medical Association, and approved by the International Institute for Complementary Therapists to deliver training.\nSamii discovered cuddle therapy after watching a documentary showing how popular it was overseas.\nHowever, in the UK, she finds that people are more reluctant to touch and be touched.\nShe blames the Covid pandemic and lockdowns for simultaneously making people \"crave it more\" but also be \"more fearful of having it\".\nShe explains: \"It's huge in America and in Europe, not so much over here, but we really need it and people wouldn't come to professional cuddlers like myself if we did not need that.\n\"We think we're all connected because we're online, but that's why we're so much more disconnected.\n\"We're all seeking that connection and there's no shame in saying, 'I just want to be held by someone and I want to be hugged. I want to be seen and drop my walls and and have that'.\"\nThe science of cuddles\nTouch can benefit physical and mental health, according to a paper by Danish neuroscientist Dr Julian Packheiser and his colleagues from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany.\nThey found there was no difference in health benefits in adults between touch from a familiar person or a health care professional.\nHowever, Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, argues that while touch has demonstrable benefits, the relationship between people involved is important.\nReferring to another study, she says: \"They put people in a scanner and physically hurt them; you could see the brain responding to the pain.\n\"However, when a partner held their hand, they had a reduced response to the pain. So there are chemical changes making you feel better, but that isn't a random person; that is your partner.\n\"What worries me slightly about somebody doing that professionally is you need to develop that relationship. You wouldn't just let anybody hold your hand.\n\"People like going to get their haircut or a manicure. Those are quite neutral parts of the body. Hugging might get a bit closer to their danger zones.\n\"What I'm saying is people would need to feel safe. If they didn't feel safe, it would be highly adversive to do that\".\nNumerous other studies have highlighted the benefit of touch and its potential to benefit mental and physical health.\nMr Valerio had been exploring alternative methods of healing, such as tapping and tai-chi, when he came across cuddle therapy.\n\"It relieves stress, promotes relaxation and togetherness,\" he says.\nHe says Samii has created a safe environment by playing a soothing soundtrack and getting people to take part in warm-up hug-based exercises at the start.\n\"Once you've done a few exercises, to break down those walls, it feels like the most natural thing lie on the floor and cuddle a lot of strangers,\" he says.\n\"There are people are crying before we have settled into the cuddle puddle, just based on the hug-based exercises we've done and some of the emotions that are brought up.\"\nHe has also taken part in one-to-one exercises with Samii, which he says allow for \"a deeper bond\".\n\"Spooning feels vulnerable, especially being the guy spooned by a woman. It allows you to experience holding and being held,\" he says.\n\"Afterwards I feel held, I feel supported, I feel as if I've shed some of my load and my wall has been lowered.\"",

    "title": "Trump plans to announce US will refer to Arabian Gulf rather than Persian Gulf",
    "text": "Donald Trump plans to announce while on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week that the US will now refer to the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia rather than the Persian Gulf.\nThe move has prompted outrage from Iranian leaders, and last-minute efforts are being made to persuade Trump to pull back from offending Iran in the midst of vital talks on the future of the Iranian nuclear programme. “If Trump went ahead with the proposal he would manage to unite every Iranian, pro- or anti-regime, against him, and that is a near impossible achievement,” one diplomat said.\nThe Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said he hoped the absurd rumour about a name change was disinformation, adding that names of Middle East waterways did “not imply ownership by any particular nation, but rather reflects a shared respect for the collective heritage of humanity”.\n“The name Persian Gulf, like many geographical designations, is deeply rooted in human history. Iran has never objected to the use of names such as the Sea of Oman, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea or Red Sea. In contrast, politically motivated attempts to alter the historically established name of the Persian Gulf are indicative of hostile intent toward Iran and its people, and are firmly condemned. Such biased actions are an affront to all Iranians, regardless of their background or place of residence.\n“Any shortsighted step in this connection will have no validity or legal or geographical effect, it will only bring the wrath of all Iranians from all walks of life and political persuasion in Iran, the US and across the world.”\nArab nations have pushed for a change to the geographic name of the body of water off the southern coast of Iran, while Iran has maintained its historic ties to the Gulf.\nThe term Persian Gulf has been used since Roman times and the Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, with Iranians tracing their history back to the Persian empire. The use of “Gulf of Arabia” and “Arabian Gulf” is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran – formerly Persia – threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the company’s decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps.\nBut Trump regards the US decision to change how the US administration describes the Gulf as a gift to Arab leaders that will lead them to offer concessions regarding their relations with Israel. The move comes several months after Trump said the US would refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”.\nEuropean diplomats trying to broker a deal between the US and Iran over the nuclear programme are urging the Iranian leadership not to “lose it” over Trump’s actions, but there are fears that hardliners in Iran opposed to the principle of talks with the US will use Trump’s gesture as a lever with which to argue the US cannot be trusted.\nBut JD Vance, the vice-president, speaking at a Munich Security Conference event in Washington, gave a very upbeat account of the talks, saying: “So far so good ... Our proposition is simple: we don’t care if people want nuclear power. They can have civil nuclear power. We don’t mind that. But you can’t have the kind of enrichment programme that allows you to get to a nuclear weapon and that’s where we draw the line.”\nHe said the two sides might be on the verge of a deal that “reintegrates” Iran into the global economy.\nHis reference to a “kind of enrichment programme” suggests the Americans may be prepared to allow Iranians to enrich uranium to some degree under the supervision of the UN’s nuclear inspectors, the IAEA.",

    "title": "Vladimir Putin rejects ceasefire ultimatum proposed by European leaders",
    "text": "Vladimir Putin has rejected an ultimatum by European leaders to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine or face increased sanctions, but has proposed holding direct negotiations with Kyiv this week.\nThe leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland told the Russian president either to sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers to Ukraine.\n“All of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he’s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now,” said UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, at a joint press conference of the five leaders in Kyiv.\nStarmer said the leaders were demanding “an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and [are] clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions, and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressure Russia back to the table.”\nStarmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz arrived in the Ukrainian capital on the same train on Saturday morning, while Donald Tusk travelled on a separate train. The leaders met Zelenskyy for talks in central Kyiv. It is Macron’s first visit to Kyiv since summer 2022, and the first visit for Merz as chancellor, having only taken office this week.\n“All five leaders had a fruitful call with @POTUS focused on peace efforts,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on X, adding a picture of the five men gathered around a mobile phone on speaker mode.\nSybiha added: “Ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday. If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.”\nRussia’s response to the ultimatum came in a press briefing for Russian media and western television networks, held in the Kremlin close to 2am local time on Sunday morning. Putin rejected the calls for a ceasefire, but said he was ready for direct negotiations with Ukraine.\nHe suggested delegations from the two countries could meet in Istanbul this Thursday to begin talks. “We don’t exclude that during these negotiations we will be able to agree on new ceasefires,” Putin said.\nMacron said on Sunday that Putin’s talks proposal was “a first step, but not enough”. “An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations,” the French president said, adding that the Russian leader was “looking for a way out, but he still wants to buy time”.\nUkraine and European capitals have previously demanded a full ceasefire as a precondition to starting negotiations. Putin left the briefing, for which journalists had been kept waiting for up to seven hours, without answering any questions.\nThere was no immediate readout from the White House on the call, or on whether Trump had made specific commitments if Putin rejects the ceasefire.\nTrump and the US administration have said a 30-day ceasefire could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement such a ceasefire, but Russia has so far refused, saying it would only do so if all western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were halted.\nIn an early sign that Russia may not be receptive to the latest ultimatum, the hawkish former president, Dmitry Medvedev, wrote on X: “Macron, Merz, Starmer, and Tusk were supposed to discuss peace in Kyiv. Instead, they are blurting out threats against Russia … You think that’s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses.”\nInstead, Moscow unilaterally declared a three-day ceasefire beginning on 8 May, which Kyiv said was designed to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia during celebrations of 80 years of the Soviet victory in the second world war, held in Moscow on Friday.\nThousands of troops marched through Red Square for the annual Victory Day parade, with numerous world leaders in attendance, most notably China’s Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Robert Fico and Aleksandar Vučić, the prime minister of EU member Slovakia and the president of EU hopeful Serbia, respectively, also attended the parade, drawing irritation from other European leaders.\nFighting has continued along the frontlines during the supposed ceasefire, both sides have said, but Russia has largely refrained from drone and missile attacks on Ukraine.\n“Putin didn’t need conditions when he wanted a ceasefire to have a parade, and he doesn’t need them now. Ukraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again, but again and again Putin has refused,” said Starmer.\nStarmer said Putin had drawn the wrong lessons from the second world war. “We understand the lessons of history, the lesson that any veteran of Normandy or north Africa or of any other campaign will tell you, but that Putin has not yet grasped. There is no glory in aggression and conquest, glory comes from fighting for your country, defending the people, and winning the peace,” he said.\nMacron also referenced VE Day, and said that “the defence of the principles on which our continent and, more generally, the international order is based” was at stake in the war in Ukraine.\nThe four European leaders visited Kyiv’s Maidan on Saturday morning with Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska. Thousands of flags have been erected in the central square to remember those killed in the war with Russia. The leaders paid their respects and had a moment of silence, before heading to the talks with Zelenskyy. The five then had a virtual meeting with other leaders on progress being made for a so-called “air, land, maritime and regeneration force” that is planned to be part of a peace deal.\nTrump has yet to comment publicly on his conversation with the group of leaders. On Friday, he was asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he had a message for Putin. “I have a message for both parties: get this war ended,” he said, adding: “Get this stupid war finished. That’s my message for both of them.”\nThe Trump administration has so far appeared to be much tougher on Kyiv than Moscow, but there are some small signals that the mood in Washington might be changing, after a positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Vatican on the sidelines of the pope’s funeral.\nEven the vice-president, JD Vance, seen as the most sceptical of voices on support for Ukraine, has criticised Moscow’s stance in recent days. “Right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they’re asking for too much,” he said this week.\nThe US embassy in Kyiv put out a public warning late on Friday night that it had received intelligence of a “potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days”. It did not give further details, but it later emerged that Russia will close its airspace over the Kapustin Yar missile testing range on Monday and Tuesday, which could indicate the potential launch of ballistic missiles.",

    "text": "Danny Dyer has said receiving a letter from his daughter Dani while at a rehab facility in 2016 was what convinced him to continue his treatment.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, the actor said he'd \"had enough\" of the treatment he'd received and was \"going to go\".\n\"Then they read a letter out from home, from my daughter Dani, and it made me sit back down in that seat,\" he told presenter Lauren Laverne.\nWhilst he did not share what his then 20-year-old daughter had written, he said he \"grew up and understood this is my life and fame and all that stuff is toxic\".\nDanny Dyer, who shot to fame in the 1999 film Human Traffic, has gone on to become one of the most recognisable stars of British TV and film.\nIn his interview, the 47-year-old spoke about how fame has affected his personal life, leading him to make \"a lot of bad decisions\".\nHe said at one stage of his career, he was \"doing a lot of drugs\".\n\"I'd go to nightclubs and DJ sometimes but in general just wave off of balconies and I'd get paid quite a lot of money to do it,\" he added.\nDyer says looking back is \"awful\" and that his days of \"hedonism\" and \"mad behaviour\" are over.\nHe said one of his turning points came in 2013, when he was offered the role of Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter in EastEnders, which he says he took because he \"had no money\".\n\"I had bailiffs [coming round], no-one would hire me and the more I'm doing these club appearances, the more drugs I'm taking, and drink, so I'm in this weird spiral.\"\nFour years later, he made the decision to go to rehab in Cape Town during an awards show after-party at his house.\n\"I remember I had this moment where I was sitting in my ensuite trying to work out how to put a pair of jeans on - I was that off my head.\n\"I looked up, I looked at my wife and I could just see how tired she looked and I could hear kids running around downstairs, and I thought 'I need to sort my life out',\" he added.\nDyer says it made him realise how addiction \"affects so many people around you, not just yourself\".\nDyer, who is nominated for best male comedy performance at Sunday's Bafta TV Awards for his role in Mr. Bigstuff, has also experienced success with Disney hit Rivals this year.\nHe said a lot of the work he took in the early stages of his career was due to the lack of money he had and the added pressure of becoming a first-time parent with his now-wife Joanne at the age of 19.\n\"I'd made a few films but I just wasn't getting paid any money and I was desperate to get on the property ladder,\" he said.\n\"I was still living on a council estate with my daughter and Jo.\"\nDyer says he then got offered a documentary series in 2006 called The Real Football Factories and \"couldn't believe the money that was offered to me\".\n\"I can't watch them back now [the documentaries], I cringe at them, but I needed to earn money, I needed to get a house and I needed to do the right thing,\" he added.\nYou can listen to Danny Dyer's episode of Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 at 10:00 on Sunday.

    "title": "The art of making ‘a little mess’ brings Nicolas Party’s showstopper to Bath",
    "text": "There was a time when Nicolas Party would be pursued by police for decorating trains and buildings across Europe with his distinctive street art. Now, grand galleries and museums invite him to unleash his visions on their walls.\nHis latest extraordinary piece, a large mural in soft pastel inspired by the works of a 17th-century Dutch artist and an 18th-century British master has materialised at the Holburne Museum in Bath.\nAs the finishing touches were being put to the work, Party said he was thrilled that the Holburne, housed in a late-18th-century building and the custodian of paintings by the likes of Thomas Gainsborough and George Stubbs, was hosting his work. “It’s great to be in a grand place like this.”\nFor his new piece, his first major mural in an English gallery, Party borrowed from a small oil painting in the Holburne’s collection, A Brawl Between Peasants, by Benjamin Gerritsz. Cuyp, a Dutch painter known for his allegorical oil panels and landscapes, influenced by Rembrandt.\nOver four days he recreated the rather violent image over a whole wall of a gallery, raising an awful lot of pastel dust.\nHe used pastels again for a second, smaller work, this time on linen – a depiction of two horses in the style of Stubbs’s horse and lion paintings, with a calm, ghostly human face between them.\nThe second work was then hung at the centre of the mural, obscuring much of the action. Party’s mural is called A Brawl Between Peasants, After Benjamin Gerritsz, 2025. The second, smaller piece is Portrait With Two Horses, 2025.\nThe artist said he was drawn to the Dutch painting because he liked the “grim, funny” subject matter. “It’s not a portrait or a sweet landscape, it’s more unusual.” The mural is a close copy and Party said the addition of the second element – the horses and face image – made it his work.\nIt didn’t worry him that the most dramatic part of the mural was hidden behind the smaller image, he said. “I think my work becomes my work when I put the two together.”\nA chamber had to be built in front of the wall for Party to work in. The wall has to be prepared with acrylic paint, water and sawdust to create a sandpapery texture that holds the pastel.\n“So that makes a little mess and the pastel generates a lot of dust. That’s why we have to be enclosed.” He then uses both hands, applying the pastel and rubbing it to create textures and colours. “It’s quite tiring so I use both arms.”\nThe piece is the showstopper in an exhibition called Nicolas Party: Copper & Dust, which features two rooms of smaller works including striking landscapes, still lifes and portraits, created out of oil on copper.\nChris Stephens, the director of the Holburne, said the gallery was excited to show Party’s work. “With his deep knowledge of the history of art, especially his interest in 17th-century Dutch painting and in 18th-century pastels, both of which feature in the Holburne’s collection, Nicolas’s art is in a perfect setting.”",

    "title": "Aid groups voice alarm as US pushes Israeli plan for Gaza assistance",
    "text": "Aid groups have voiced alarm at US moves to pressure them into accepting an Israeli proposal to resume limited humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory under strictly controlled conditions.\nThe Trump administration has attempted to strong-arm international agencies – including the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) – into accepting Israel’s stringent rules for resuming deliveries, according to sources familiar with the discussions and news reports.\nA two-month blockade has left the coastal enclave’s 2.3 million inhabitants facing the prospect of starvation. The blockade was imposed by the Israel Defense Forces in March after the collapse of a ceasefire to the conflict that broke out after Hamas’s October 2023 attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel. So far, more than 52,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel’s military response.\nUnder the auspices of a newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is based in Geneva, aid would be delivered to four “hubs”, where recipients would have to go to collect it under the watchful gaze of private US security contractors, who would use facial recognition technology to vet who receives it.\nIsrael insists the stringent measures are necessary to prevent aid being stolen or diverted to Hamas, although some assistance organizations have said they have seen no evidence of such practices.\nAid groups have so far refused to participate in the scheme, fearing it violates “fundamental humanitarian principles” and breaches international law.\nSome have privately voiced concerns about potential “complicity in war crimes because of how the aid will be distributed”, according to one person in close contact with assistance organizations, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n“There is a concern that this aid plan risks enabling war crimes related to forced displacement, starvation and internment,” the person said. “This is a scheme to make it seem like this is about aid, but what it’s really about is entrenching military occupation of Gaza.”\nIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said this week that the Gaza population would be moved “for its own protection” under an intensive new Israeli military offensive. Israeli officials have indicated a plan to concentrate the entire population in the south of the strip.\nOpposition has been firm even as some organizations, including World Central Kitchen and the WFP, have admitted that an inability to replenish supplies has left them unable to continue feeding the population.\nEven if aid is resumed, some groups say, the conditions Israel is stipulating will prevent it reaching many of those in need.\n“If you centralize, privatize and militarize aid delivery through this proposed hub model, it means that people will be excluded from getting humanitarian assistance,” said Joseph Belliveau, executive director of MedGlobal, which has been providing medical assistance – including to severely malnourished children – at 16 sites in Gaza.\n“People simply won’t be able to come to these distribution sites, either because of fear, logistical constraints, or distance. Even more importantly, many will be reluctant to come to centralized sites that are overseen by armed personnel, and given the way that that Israel has fought this war with incredible numbers of civilian casualties.\n“The best thing that the US and Israeli authorities can do is to lift the restrictions and allow us to … work safely [and] protect medical sites [and] humanitarian workers.”\nBut with living conditions growing increasingly dire, the Trump administration is pressing humanitarian outfits to accept Israel’s terms. US officials have reportedly met the UN and aid groups this week, even threatening to slash the WFP’s budget – which Washington partly funds – if it refuses to accept, according to the Times of Israel.\nDonald Trump told reporters in the White House on Monday that “the people of Gaza are starving and we’re going to help them get some food”. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met members of the UN security council on Wednesday to discuss the Israeli plan, according to the Washington Post.\nTrump has previously proposed having US taking ownership of Gaza and converting it into a “Riviera”, a scheme which would involve relocating its population to other countries.\nA state department spokesperson said Trump was seeking “creative solutions” that would “protect Israel, leave Hamas empty-handed, and help Gazans”.\n“We welcome moves to quickly get urgent food aid into Gaza in a way that prevents it from falling into the hands of terrorists, such as Hamas,” the spokesperson said. “We support a plan to get in aid now and urge others to do so as well.\n“Endless press releases and Hamas appeasement haven’t delivered food, medicine, or shelter to those who need it. This is a new approach with one focus: get help to people NOW.”",

Today is the longest I’ve stayed without checking my phone in four days.”\nNasreen Rehman, 74, was similarly relieved by the announcement. “Thank goodness, we’ve averted something which could have been catastrophic but already a lot of lives have been lost.”\nAfter 26 people were killed in an attack at a popular local tourist destination in Kashmir, India paused the vital Indus waters treaty which governs the distribution and use of waters from the Indus River between the two countries.\nRehman is concerned about the suspension of this longstanding agreement. “At the end of the day, we are human beings. We share a history and we share the future. Now we have threats of stopping water? What does that mean?”\nWhile a ceasefire pulls both nations back from the brink of all-out war, there are still concerns about how robust it will be.\n“How many times in the past year have we heard the word ceasefire? We’ve heard that far too many times in the context of Israel-Palestine and it has meant nothing,” said Rajiv Sinah, 27.\n“Our demonstration, which was called a few days ago, is no less relevant today despite the news of a supposed ceasefire because now we need to advocate for a way forward.\n“The people of India, the people of Pakistan and the people of Kashmir want nothing more than peace and to be able to live their own lives and instead they are losing their lives, their livelihoods, their families at the behest of governments that do not represent their people,” Sinah added.\nTarun Gidwani, 36, is similarly apprehensive. “It was a huge relief but even though there’s a ceasefire, there isn’t the de-escalation. Tensions are still quite high and there’s no real roadmap to stability, especially in Kashmir region.”\nBefore the announcement of the ceasefire, he described feeling “really worried”.\n“It’s two nuclear powers engaged in aerial attack in the most densely populated region on the planet. Back home in India, there were mock drills in schools and offices. It was a tense atmosphere.”\nShakuntala Banaji is hopeful that the ceasefire might hold. “I think that the national interests of both India and Pakistan lie in sustaining this ceasefire,” she said.\nShe called on government, “particularly Labour and the prime minister, to stop playing division politics between Hindus and Muslims and between people who come from India and Pakistan by favouring one country over the other”.\nThis week, on the same day a trade-deal described as “landmark” by Keir Starmer was announced between the UK and India, the Home Office announced restrictions on Pakistani nationals applying for work or study visas.\nLast year, Starmer caused anger after singling out the Bangladeshi community in a debate hosted by the Sun about immigration, saying: “At the moment people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed.”\nBanaji said: “They need to think very carefully about emboldening a nuclear power when they have no support here in the diaspora for that kind of politics.”\nSumming up the mood of many who attended the demonstration, she said: “Our shared humanity across the India-Pakistan border and in Kashmir should trump all the other considerations of race and religion in the region. If we are to move forward we would have to move forward together.”",

    "title": "Albania votes in general elections as PM Edi Rama seeks a fourth term",
    "text": "Albanians are casting ballots in the general election, with Prime Minister Edi Rama seeking an unprecedented fourth term after a campaign dominated by promises of European Union membership and corruption allegations.\nPolling stations opened at 7am local time (05:00 GMT) on Sunday and would close at 7pm (17:00 GMT), with results expected on Monday.\nNearly 3.7 million Albanians, including hundreds of thousands living abroad, are eligible to vote. For the first time, members of the diaspora can cast their ballots by mail.\nRama, leader of the governing Socialist Party since 2013, has positioned himself as the architect of Albania’s EU future. He has pledged that the country will join the bloc by 2030, repeating the promise at his final rally: “We will get our fourth mandate, and we will not lose a single day for Albania 2030 in the EU.”\nRama’s main rival, 80-year-old Sali Berisha, a former president and prime minister, leads the conservative Democratic Party.\nDespite being banned from entering the United States and the United Kingdom over alleged corruption, which he denies, Berisha has retained a loyal following and adopted slogans including “Make Albania Great Again”.\nRama has faced allegations of state capture, with opposition voices warning that the political playing field is far from even.\nCritics say Rama’s dominance over public institutions has undermined democratic checks.\nRama’s administration has not escaped scrutiny, with his close ally – Tirana’s mayor Erion Veliaj – arrested this year over alleged corruption and money laundering. Both men deny the allegations.\n‘I want to leave the country’\nThe political contest is, in many ways, a rematch of old rivals. Rama and Berisha have dominated public life since the fall of communism in 1990. Many younger voters have grown disillusioned with both.\n“I will vote for new politicians because those like Rama and Berisha have been here for three decades and they only replace themselves,” said 21-year-old Arber Qazimi, speaking to the Reuters news agency.\nOthers, like Erisa, an economics student, plan to abstain entirely. “I am only thinking how to go out of the country to study and then stay there and never come back,” she said, echoing the sentiment of many among the estimated one million Albanians who have emigrated in the past decade.\nWith the Socialists potentially needing allies to retain their narrow majority, smaller parties could prove decisive in shaping the next government.\nThe campaign trail shifted largely to social media platforms, though a yearlong TikTok ban – imposed over online bullying and incitement – has led to accusations of censorship.\nThe Democratic Party brought in American political strategist Chris LaCivita, known for his role in US President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, in a bid to sharpen their message.",

    "title": "Trump floats cutting Chinese tariffs from 145% to 80% before weekend talks",
    "text": "Donald Trump has floated cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 80% before a weekend meeting as he looks to de-escalate the trade war.\nTop US officials are expected to meet a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first significant talks between the two nations since Trump provoked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports.\nThe US president wrote “80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B” on his social media account on Friday morning, referring to Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary.\nBessent and Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, will meet their counterparts in Geneva in the most senior known conversations between the two countries in months, the Trump administration announced this week. It comes amid growing US market concern over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods.\nNo country has been hit harder by Trump’s trade war than China, the world’s biggest exporter and second largest economy. When the US president announced his “liberation day” tariffs on 2 April, China retaliated with tariffs of its own, a move that Trump viewed as demonstrating a lack of respect. The tariffs on each other’s goods have been mounting since then, with the US tariffs against China now at 145% and China tariffs on the US at 125%.\nChinese trade with the US slumped in April even as its total exports beat forecasts, official figures showed, as trade representatives from both nations prepared to meet this weekend in the midst of a gruelling trade war between the superpower rivals.\nExports to the US – one of China’s top trading partners – fell 17.6% in April, data showed. Against that backdrop, analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected exports to rise just 2% year-on-year last month. However, they beat expectations, coming in at 8.1%.\n“The damage of the US tariffs has not shown up in the trade data in April,” Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.\n“This may be partly due to transshipment through other countries, and partly because of trade contracts that were signed before the tariffs were announced,” he added.\n“I expect trade data will weaken in the next few months gradually.”\nTrade between the world’s two largest economies has slowed considerably since Trump’s rounds of tariffs on China. Levies on many Chinese products are now as high as 145%, with cumulative duties on some goods a staggering 245%.\nBeijing has responded with 125% tariffs on imports of US goods, along with other measures targeting American firms.\nBessent and the trade representative Jamieson Greer are due to meet the Chinese vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Switzerland on Saturday and Sunday, marking the first talks between the superpowers since Trump unveiled his tariffs.\nOn Thursday, Britain became the first to announce a deal with the US that reduces tariffs on British cars and lifts them on steel and aluminium, while, in return, Britain will open up markets to US beef and other farm products.\nBut analysts said traders were more excited about the Republican leader’s comments on the forthcoming talks with China in which he hinted at easing the stiff measures aimed at the world’s No 2 economy.\nTrump told reporters that he thought the negotiations would be “substantive”, and when asked if reducing the levies was a possibility he said “it could be”.\n“We’re going to see. Right now you can’t get any higher. It’s at 145% so we know it’s coming down. I think we’re going to have a very good relationship.”\nSpeaking on Friday, the deputy foreign minister, Hua Chunying, said China had full confidence in its ability to manage US trade issues.\n“We have no fear,” Hua told reporters, adding that the trade policy of the US administration could be sustained. “We do not want any kind of war with any country. But we have to face up to the reality. As you can see, people have full confidence in our capability to overcome all the difficulties … Ordinary people in the US already feel suffering from the tariff war.”\nApril’s economic data showed that China’s imports beat expectations, dropping 0.2%, compared with the 6% slide analysts had estimated. Purchases from overseas were being closely watched as a gauge of consumer demand in China, which has remained sluggish.\nWith Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "text": "At the end of a waitressing shift, Kristina Lampert used to separate her tips in two piles: Canadian cash and American.\nBut it's been weeks since she has done that.\nFreighters, the restaurant where she works, is one of the first places people can grab a bite after crossing the US-Canada border between Sarnia, Ontario, and Port Huron, Michigan.\nThe Blue Water Bridge, which connects the US and Canada, is in full view from the restaurant's windows.\n\"A lot of people used to come over and say 'we're here for the view',\" she says of Canadian diners. \"I haven't heard that at all recently.\"\nBorder towns noticed almost instantly when US President Donald Trump began imposing tariffs on countries around the world and saying he wanted to make Canada the 51st US state - because the number of Canadians crossing the border plummeted.\nBorder crossings between the US and Canada are down some 17% since Trump started bringing in tariffs, according to CBP data.\nCanadian's car trips to the US are down almost 32% compared to March 2024, according to Statistics Canada.\nLike many of the towns that dot along the 5,525 mile (8,891km) border, the economies of Port Huron and Sarnia are linked and in some ways dependent on one another. Port Huron is a manufacturing town of less than 30,000 people with a quaint downtown and lots of retail, offering visitors an enticing opportunity for a day-trip.\nOn a day where there is little traffic, a Sarnia resident can cross the border and be in Michigan in a matter of minutes.\nMany of these towns faced their first test more than five years ago when the Covid-19 pandemic shut crossings down for 19 months and left local economies reeling.\nNow, they are seeing a second economic hit due to Trump's trade war, with many Canadians choosing to \"buy Canadian\" and reducing travel to the US in response to the fraying relationship between the two neighbouring countries.\nOne place this is being felt is at Sarnia's Duty Free, the last place you can purchase goods before leaving Canada and entering the US. The shelves of perfume and liquor are fuller and the parking lot is emptier since tariffs tensions began.\nBarbara Barett, the executive director of Frontier Duty Free Association, says some of the 32 land-border duty frees in Canada have seen as much as an 80% decrease in sales since Trump's return to the White House. Most stores have seeing a 50-60% drop in business.\n\"We're 100% reliant on the travel across the border,\" she says of duty frees. \"Our stores are often pillars of these communities - communities depend on them.\"\nAnd while the crossing at Port Huron-Sarnia is faring better than most, on a Friday in May the parking lot of the Sarnia Duty Free is almost empty.\nTania Lee, who runs the store with her family, says that has become the new norm.\nOn Easter weekend - usually one of their busiest of the year, as Canadians take advantage of the break to stop in at a favourite restaurant and go to a church service in Port Huron - cars were few and far between, and sales were not what they should have been, she says.\n\"We are suffering because of collateral damage at the border,\" Ms Lee says of her second-generation family business.\nShe notes that people who live in border towns often cross the boundary multiple times a week. Ms Lee, for example, has a mailbox at a shipping facility in Port Huron that she visits regularly, as do her neighbours.",

    "title": "This American pope: Leo XIV’s bloodline reflects the US melting pot",
    "text": "Pope Leo XIV, who on Thursday was elected as the first-ever US-born leader of the Roman Catholic church, has a familial bloodline that reflects his homeland’s fraught relationship with race – and why the nation’s stature as a melting pot of origins has long endured, records unearthed by genealogists show.\nThe maternal grandfather of 69-year-old Robert Prevost, the newly minted pope, was evidently born abroad in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, according to birth records that professional genealogist Chris Smothers cited to ABC News in a recent report. When Leo’s grandfather, Joseph Martinez, obtained an 1887 marriage license to wed the future pope’s grandmother, Louise Baquié, he listed his birthplace as Haiti, which at the time was the same territory as Santo Domingo, Smothers noted.\nBaquié’s birth records, meanwhile, indicate that she was born in Louisiana’s most prominent city, New Orleans, to parents who were reportedly married at a local Catholic church.\nRecords from the 1900 census show that Joseph – apparently the son of a Louisianan – and Louise lived at a home in New Orleans’s Seventh Ward, a bastion for the city’s Creole people. The couple’s home later was among hundreds that were demolished to make way for a highway overpass linking New Orleans’s suburbs to its globally renowned French Quarter, a move that drastically reduced the area’s population and economically devastated the scores of Black businesses that had been prevalent there.\nThose same census records identified Leo’s maternal grandparents as Black. Two of his aunts were similarly identified, just about four years after the Plessy v Ferguson US supreme court case – which originated in New Orleans – upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation in the country.\nBy 1920, the Martinez family had moved north to Chicago and away from the racially oppressive US south. The future pope’s mother, the Chicago-born Mildred Agnes Martinez, was eight at the time. And the census that decade listed the Martinezes as white.\nIt would not be until 1954 that the US supreme court would issue the ruling that overturned the Plessy v Ferguson precedent and deemed racial segregation unconstitutional – and even then, many communities across the nation spent years flouting the decision. Multiple genealogists theorized that the Martinezes may have strategically shifted their racial identity to assimilate in Chicago, which – though further north – has had its own history of discrimination and oppression on the basis of skin color.\n“You can understand [that] people may have intentionally sought to obfuscate their heritage,” Jari Honora, a family historian for the Historic New Orleans Collection, told the Associated Press. Honora added that “always life has been precarious for people of color”.\nMildred Martinez eventually married Louis Marius Prevost. The librarian and her husband – a second world war veteran and educator – raised three sons in Chicago. The youngest, Robert, was ordained a priest in 1982; became the worldwide leader of the Catholic religious order colloquially known as the Augustinians; led a Peruvian diocese; was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in September 2023; and headed the Vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops around the world.\nThe US registered a record-setting 47.8 million immigrants in 2023, three-quarters of whom were naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents or visa holders – all of whom buttressed the country’s centuries-old, metaphorical reputation as a melting pot.\nThat status has come under threat when Donald Trump clinched a second US presidency the following year – and his administration mounted an immigration crackdown marked by steady news of detentions and deportations after he returned to the Oval Office in January.\nLeo’s fellow cardinals elected him to succeed the late Francis after a two-day conclave that concluded less than four months into Trump’s second presidency. And one of Leo’s older brothers, suburban Chicago resident and retired Catholic school principal John Prevost, quickly told the New York Times: “I know he’s not happy with what’s going on with immigration.”\nSocial media users just as rapidly flocked to an account seemingly belonging to Leo and noted how it had demonstrated a willingness to be critical of the administration’s positions. One of the account’s entries reposted an article about Catholic bishops in California who attributed “racism and nativism” to Trump’s use of the phrase “bad hombres” for certain Mexicans.\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how much Leo might be a foil to the chief executive of the global superpower from which he hails, among other issues confronting the pope. And there is no indication Leo has ever publicly discussed his racial identity much.\nJohn Prevost, for his part, told the Times that his brothers did not discuss their Louisiana roots. He also said his immediate family did not identify as Black.\nA Vatican news release said Leo’s father was of French and Italian descent. It said the pope’s mother was of Spanish ancestry.\nWhatever the case, Loyola Marymount University professor Kim R Harris, who teaches African American religious thought and practice, remarked to the AP that she hopes Leo’s papacy “brings to light who we are as Americans and who we are as a people of the diaspora”.\n“When I think about a person who brings so much of the history of this country in his bones,” Harris said, “it brings a whole new perspective and widens the vision of who we all are.”",

    "title": "US reportedly planning to deport migrants to Libya despite ‘clear’ violation of court order",
    "text": "The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport a group of immigrants to Libya, despite a judge’s efforts on Wednesday to block any such flights and the state department’s previous condemnation of the “life-threatening” prison conditions in the country.\nReuters cited three unnamed US officials as saying the deportations could happen this week. Two of the officials said the immigrants, whose nationalities are not known, could be flown to the north African country as soon as Wednesday, but they added the plans could still change. The New York Times also cited a US official confirming the deportation plans.\nThe reported moves come as a federal judge ruled in favor of immigrant rights advocates, who asked him to block any deportation of immigrants to Libya. District court judge Brian Murphy agreed with advocates that a previous injunction he had issued already barred such flights.\n“If there is any doubt – the Court sees none – the allegedly imminent removals,” Murphy clarified, “would clearly violate this Court’s Order.”\nIt was not clear what Libya would be getting in return for taking any deportees. In a rare show of unity, Libya’s rival governments have responded to news reports by saying that they would refuse to accept any deportees from the United States.\nHuman rights groups condemned the reported plans, noting the country’s poor record on human rights practices and harsh treatment of detainees.\n“Migrants have long been trafficked, tortured and ransomed in Libya. The country is in a civil war. It is not a safe place to send anyone,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now (Dawn), wrote on X.\nAaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, wrote on the platform alongside a picture of a Libyan detention facility: “Don’t look away. This is what Libya’s migrant detention facilities look like. This is what Trump is doing.”\nReichlin-Melnick added: “Amnesty International called these places a ‘hellscape’ where beatings are common and sexual violence are rampant. There are reports of human trafficking and even slavery.”\nClaudia Lodesani, head of programs for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said the group was “very concerned” about the possible consequences of such a plan, saying reports by media outlets and human rights organisations showed that “Libya is not a safe country for migrants”\nLodesani pointed to a 2023 United Nations report which documented “widespread practices of arbitrary detention, torture, rape and slavery and concluding there were grounds to believe a wide array of crimes against humanity have been committed against migrants in Libya”.\nGovernment agencies, including the defense department, the White House, state department and department of homeland security did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment. The defense department later directed inquiries to the White House.\nReports of planned deportations to Libya come as the Trump administration is expanding its efforts to negotiate the deportations of US migrants to third-party countries, including Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda. This is alongside the at least 238 Venezuelan immigrants already deported to a prison in El Salvador.\nLibya is a major transit point for Europe-bound asylum seekers. For years, human rights organisations have documented how migrants trapped in the country are at the mercy of militias and smugglers. Tens of thousands of people from sub-Saharan Africa are kept indefinitely in overcrowded refugee detention centres where they are subjected to abuses and torture.\nIn its annual human rights report released last year, the US state department criticised Libya’s “harsh and life-threatening prison conditions” and “arbitrary arrest or detention”, citing how migrants , including children, had “no access to immigration courts or due process”.\nThe news has prompted condemnation from aid agencies and NGOs that operate in the central Mediterranean, which have long warned about the harsh conditions faced by asylum seekers in Libya. They have also accused European governments of being complicit in such treatment by working with Libya to intercept migrants.\n‘‘For 10 years now since our foundation, as a search and rescue organisation, we have continuously highlighted that Libya is not a safe place for migrants and refugees,” said Mirka Schäfer, a political expert for the German search-and-rescue organisation SOS Humanity. “Evidence from survivors onboard our vessel Humanity 1, includes refugees with traces of torture on their bodies, gunshot wounds, pain caused by beatings, physical and psychological wounds while in transit, in detention camps in Libya, or fleeing Libya across the Mediterranean.”\nOne person onboard the Humanity 1 ship said criminal groups operating in Libya “sell people like they would sell bread”.\nLuca Casarini, the Italian founder of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, said the reported move by Trump was “an endorsement of the horror that has characterised his administration’s policies since the very beginning”.\n‘‘Libya is one of the most hellish places on Earth, where mafias and smugglers operate with the complicity of the European Union. But Trump goes a step further. The American president claims ownership of this horror by deporting people to a hell that is Libya, flaunting his power. It is a move that drags our civilisation toward the abyss.’’\nLibya’s government of national unity said on Wednesday it rejected the use of its territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent. The government added there was no coordination with the US regarding the reception of migrants.\nTrump, who made immigration a major issue during his election campaign, has launched aggressive enforcement action since taking office, increasing troops to the southern border and pledging to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the US.\nAs of Monday, the Trump administration had deported 152,000 people, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump’s administration has tried to encourage migrants to leave voluntarily by threatening steep fines, trying to strip away legal status, and sending migrants to notorious prisons in Guantánamo Bay and El Salvador.\nThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, last week said the US was not satisfied with sending migrants only to El Salvador, and hinted that Washington was looking to expand the number of countries to which it could deport people.\n“We are working with other countries to say: we want to send you some of the most despicable human beings; will you do this as a favour to us?” Rubio said at a cabinet meeting at the White House last Wednesday. “And the further away from America, the better.”\nA fourth US official said the administration had for several weeks been looking at a number of countries where it might be able to send migrants, including Libya.\nOn 19 April the supreme court temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelans it accused of being gang members.\nTrump’s administration, which has invoked a rarely used wartime law, has urged the justices to lift or narrow their order.\nReuters contributed to this report",

    "title": "UK Lawyers for Israel condemned over claim war may reduce obesity in Gaza",
    "text": "A UK-based advocacy group for Israel has been criticised for suggesting a reduction in obesity resulting from the war in Gaza may increase life expectancy there.\nThe comments by UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), which came amid warnings of impending famine in Gaza, were condemned as “sickening” by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC).\nUKLFI’s patrons include the former supreme court judge John Dyson, the former Conservative leader Michael Howard and David Pannick KC, who has represented Boris Johnson and the late queen.\nThe remarks were made by Jonathan Turner, the chief executive of UKLFI, in response to a motion due to be debated at the Co-operative Group’s annual general meeting calling for the retailer to stop selling Israeli produce.\nUrging the Co-operative council to withdraw the motion, Turner criticised the fact that it refers to an estimated death toll of 186,000. In a letter to the Co-operative Group secretary, Turner wrote that it was “totally false and misleading” to cite the figure from a letter published by the Lancet last year, which was a projected figure including indirect casualties.\nHe adds: “The [Lancet] letter also ignored factors that may increase average life expectancy in Gaza, bearing in mind that one of the biggest health issues in Gaza prior to the current war was obesity.”\nThe death toll since Israel began its assault on Gaza after the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas on southern Israel stands at more than 52,000, according to the territory’s health authority. A separate study in the Lancet found life expectancy in Gaza decreased by 34.9 years during the first 12 months of the war, about half (-46.3%) the prewar level of 75.5 years.\nBen Jamal, the director of the PSC, said: “As children in the Gaza Strip face the growing risk of starvation, illness and death, the suggestion by the head of UK Lawyers for Israel that they might benefit from weight loss is utterly sickening. These repulsive comments illustrate exactly what it means to be ‘for Israel’ and how low its apologists are prepared to sink in their attempts to justify genocide in Gaza.”\nChris Doyle, the director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu), wrote on X that the comments represented “atrocious views”. He said: “How very kind of Israel to put 2.3 million Palestinians on an enforced diet to improve their obesity levels.”\nA complaint by UKLFI led Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London to remove a display of artwork by Palestinian children in 2023 after the group claimed that it made Jewish patients feel “vulnerable, harassed and victimised”.\nIt has also threatened the UK government with legal action over its decision to suspend about 30 licences for the export of arms to Israel.\nTurner said: “We first pointed out that the letter published in the Lancet on 20 July 2024, to which the motion evidently referred, did not claim that 186,000 Gazans had died in the current war. It did, however, claim – without foundation – that 186,000 Gaza would be likely to die eventually as a result of the war.\n“So we pointed out, secondly, that this claim was based on entirely unfounded speculation, which also ignored factors that might result in lengthening the lives of Gazans, given the public health situation existing in Gaza prior to the war, including the extent of obesity. These factors include the possible reduction in the availability of confectionery and cigarettes.\n“In the context in which they were made, our statements were accurate and objective.”",

    "title": "Sudan to cut ties with United Arab Emirates over alleged RSF support",
    "text": "Sudan’s security and defence council has declared that it will break diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates over its alleged backing of the paramilitary Sudanese Rapid Support Forces.\nDuring a televised speech on Tuesday, Sudan’s defence minister, Yassin Ibrahim, said Sudan was “severing diplomatic relations with the UAE” and recalling its ambassador, claiming the Gulf nation had breached Sudan’s sovereignty through its RSF “proxy”, which has been fighting the army in a bloody civil war since April 2023.\nThe UAE insists it does not provide arms to the RSF, and on Monday fended off an attempt to persuade the international court of justice in The Hague to examine Sudan’s claims the UAE was complicit in a genocide in Darfur. The ICJ said it could not examine the claim because the UAE, a party to the genocide convention, had put in a reservation that prevented the ICJ adjudicating on claims that the UAE had breached the convention.\nSudan’s diplomatic move came as alliance of aid agencies working in Sudan expressed deep concern about what it described as “the deliberate targeting of critical infrastructure in Port Sudan”, the main artery for aid into the north African country.\nA succession of drone and missile attacks, starting on 4 May, have hit Port Sudan international airport, fuel storage facilities, the maritime port and at least one hotel, as well as water and power facilities, in direct violation of the fundamental principles of distinction and proportionality under international humanitarian law, the NGOs said.\nThey said: “These assaults have caused widespread fires, heavy smoke over residential areas, and flight cancellations, further endangering the lives and wellbeing of thousands of innocent civilians.”\nSince the conflict’s outset, aid agencies have depended on Port Sudan – and particularly its airport and seaport – as the main conduit for international assistance. It has also become the home to many internationally displaced people relocated from different states.\nThe United Nations has been forced to suspend humanitarian flights to Port Sudan after these strikes, a step that will inevitably limit the delivery of lifesaving aid.\nThe agencies said damage to power stations was also forcing them to rely on generator power, raising concerns about looming fuel shortages.\nThey said: “Further bombardment of energy and water infrastructure will deepen the risk of disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and protection crises among the most vulnerable, including women, children, and the elderly. It will also severely constrain aid agencies’ ability to respond to the growing needs in Sudan.\n“We urge all parties to the conflict to fully respect their obligations under the Geneva conventions, to differentiate between military objectives and civilian objects, and to facilitate unimpeded humanitarian access to all areas in need.”\nA British-led effort to set up a contact group among the external states both in the region and in the west to help take the first steps to create a broad roadmap for peace foundered at a London conference, partly due to differences between the UAE and Egypt.",

    "title": "Trump to embark on Middle East trip to meet Gulf allies",
    "text": "Donald Trump this week will embark on the first foreign trip of his second administration with a tour of the Middle East, as he looks to secure investment, trade and technology deals from friendly leaders with deep pockets amid turbulent negotiations around numerous regional conflicts, including Israel’s war in Gaza.\nThe tour through the Middle East is largely a repeat of his first international trip in 2017, when he was feted in the region as a transactional leader eager to secure quick wins and capable of providing support for the regional monarchies’ economic and geopolitical interests.\nHis negotiations in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will focus on a number of topics, including oil and trade, investment deals, the regional conflicts in Israel-Gaza and Yemen, and negotiations over the Iran nuclear programme among other issues.\nBut Trump’s key goal is to come out of the region saying that he put America first, say observers.\n“I think what he’s clearly looking to get out of this is deals, the announcement of multiple multi-billion dollar deals,” said Steven A Cook, the senior fellow for Middle East and Africa Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n“The president’s approach to foreign policy is heavily influenced by … his version of economic statecraft, which is to look towards the wealthy states in the Gulf and their very large sovereign wealth funds as sources of investment in the United States,” he said.\nTrump has already announced Saudi Arabia’s commitment to invest $1tn into the US economy and is hoping to secure big-ticket investments on Monday’s visit. That would be consistent with his America First policy of prioritising domestic interests, Cook said.\nThose countries may also seek access to advanced US semiconductor exports, and Saudi Arabia will want to ink a deal on civilian nuclear infrastructure, which had previously been tied to the country’s normalisation of relations with Israel. In a departure from previous policy, the Trump administration has indicated the two issues are no longer linked.\nThe Middle East trip is notable for the US president’s lack of plans to visit Israel, where Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet have floated plans to launch a larger invasion of Gaza and expel the Palestinian population there in what critics have called a broad plan of ethnic cleansing.\nThe Israel-Gaza war will loom large over the negotiations, as Saudi Arabia has said it will not normalise relations with Israel unless there is a clear path to a two-state solution, and many countries in the Middle East have spoken out against a proposal that began with Trump to expel Palestinian from Gaza to other Arab countries.\n“He could have gone to Israel like he did last time,” said Elliot Abrams, former deputy national security advisor under President George W Bush and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He added that Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, had cancelled a planned trip to Israel. “I think there’s some tension here … [Israel] knows that Trump is going to be spending a week in the Gulf hearing about Gaza, Gaza, Gaza, Gaza every day. So it’s not the best moment in US-Israel or Trump-Israel relations.”\nThere is a growing understanding in Washington and Israel that Trump has taken a step back from attempting to mediate the war in Gaza. His administration said that they would negotiate a new aid deal without the direct involvement of the Israeli government to renew deliveries of aid into Gaza, which is suffering its worst humanitarian crisis of the war since a ceasefire collapsed in March.\n“He’s the only one who speaks the same language as Netanyahu, and he’s the only one who can speak to Netanyahu in a language that Netanyahu will understand,” said Ami Ayalon, a former director of the Israel Security Agency, also known as the Shin Bet.\n“Trump again, when it comes to to the hostages, when it comes to our relations in the Palestinians, has become the center of everything in the Middle East,” he said.\nThat turns Trump’s attention to the things he can get done.\nHe has said that he plans to decide on his trip to Saudi Arabia on an announcement that the US could refer to the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia rather than the Persian Gulf.\nThat has angered Iran at a moment when the Gulf states appear largely in support of US efforts in talks on the future of the Iranian nuclear programme. As opposed to 2017, the Gulf states have largely spoken in support of renewed negotiations between the United States and Iran over the nuclear programme, but those governments were said to be unclear on the details of any deal as of yet.\n“US partners have confided to me that there are US statements on all of these issues, but they don’t yet see US policies,” said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at CSIS, a thinktank. “The US government doesn’t speak with one voice and its actions remain uncoordinated.”\nIn Saudi Arabia, Trump has enlisted his son-in-law Jared Kushner to act as a point man for the discussions ahead of the trip, CNN has reported. Kushner, who was Trump’s envoy to the region during his first administration, is said to be tasked with making progress in discussions of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham accords. But his role is also tainted by a perceived conflict-of-interest given his family’s business interests in the region.\nYet with such a complicated tableau of economic and geopolitical interests in the region, there are questions about whether the Trump administration has the focus and the team to pursue a comprehensive policy in the region. Many in Trump’s orbit say that US policy should place lower priority on the Middle East, and focus instead on China and the Indo-Pacific region.\n“I think the sense that there’s these pieces that the President is negotiating don’t respond together, and that his priority really is essentially domestic focus, securing, you know, agreements to invest in the estates,” said Cook. “Regionally, the president would like these issues to go away, and that’s why he has these compressed timelines he doesn’t want to focus on.”",

    "title": "Pickleball plan raises fear of ‘whitening’ Florida beachfront community",
    "text": "A proposal to rip out decades-old public basketball courts on Fort Lauderdale’s historic beachfront and replace them with new pickleball facilities has enraged residents, and prompted some to suggest an underlying racial motive.\nThe two oceanside courts were built within 10 years of a landmark 1962 judicial ruling that ended segregation on the Florida city’s beaches. They have remained popular with a diverse crowd of players and spectators since.\nThe Fort Lauderdale city commission and developers signed an agreement last year for a glitzy $2bn makeover of the old Bahia Mar marina and surrounding acreage that will turn the area into a “mini Monaco” with a luxury hotel, high-end residences, upmarket shopping and waterfront promenade.\nBut while protesters acknowledge the addition of pickleball courts was mentioned in the agreement, they insist it was never specified that the basketball courts would be torn up to accommodate them.\nThey fear that a conversion to pickleball will destroy the community tradition that basketball has provided at the site for generations; they also say the courts are packed every weekend with players of all ages and racial backgrounds, many traveling with their families to join in.\n“These courts are in a pretty wealthy area, you’re talking homes up to $50m, $60m, then you have the district west of the city that’s predominantly minorities, many Black residents live there,” said Leo Lorenz, co-founder of the Fort Lauderdale Beach Ballers group whose preserve the courts petition on change.org has thousands of signatures so far.\n“A lot of the people that come to the courts all live to the western side. If they don’t have a car, they’ll take a bus. Some ride their bicycles, and they all come on the weekends to play.\n“I’ve lived here for 35 years, I’m on the courts three times a week, and I’ve met so many wonderful people out there over the years. I think that we, the people who go there and use them every day, have a better understanding of what these courts represent than the commissioners. They don’t use it, so they don’t know.”\nThe campaigners concede that some elements of the development represent a welcome, ongoing revitalization of an older section of the city. That area began as a 19th-century US army fort, and later became the permanent home of the Fort Lauderdale international boat show, one of the world’s largest.\nHowever, they say surrendering the basketball courts is unacceptable. Some have even taken to social media to express their opposition.\nMari Bacon, a Fort Lauderdale realtor, suggested in a post to Facebook that the city wanted only its version of “acceptable” residents to enjoy the beach.\n“I would hate to think erasing the basketball courts would be an effort on the part of the commissioners to ‘whiten’ that section of the beach,” she wrote.\n“We are all welcome on Fort Lauderdale beaches, and an especially loved area are the picnic tables and basketball courts.”\nUnder the terms of the agreement the city commission signed last year with developers Rahn Bahia Mar llc, an affiliate of Tate Capital of Miami, a $1m public improvement fund would be set up for enhancements – including the installation of pickleball courts.\nBut Lorenz said that the first players knew that pickleball would replace the basketball courts, instead of supplementing them, was when city workers erected a sign.\nThe sign, put up last month, said that the conversion was “coming soon” and provided a telephone number for questions. The sign has since been removed.\nLorenz was among the campaigners who attended a meeting of the Fort Lauderdale commission on Tuesday, at which he said one commissioner, Pamela Beasley-Pittman, expressed a desire to keep the basketball courts open and upgrade them.\nHe said Beasley-Pittman conceded she originally voted for the development while also being unaware it meant their closure. She did not return a request for comment from the Guardian.\nFort Lauderdale’s mayor, Dean Trantalis, told the Sun-Sentinel newspaper that he was keen to explore options for preservation or relocation.\n“I don’t want to displace basketball from the beach, whether it stays where it is or moves over to another location,” he said. “There is a solution there and we will find it. It doesn’t have to be a public debate. We hear the community and we will respond.”\nJames Tate, co-owner and president of Tate Capital, told the Guardian in a written response that “this entire situation and how it has unfolded is unfortunate and incredibly disheartening”, and that the pickleball courts were openly discussed and the development unanimously approved by commissioners more than 15 months ago.\n“The reason pickleball was chosen over basketball was simple. At the time these negotiations were being had, pickleball was the fastest-growing sport in the country [and] the range of players extended from young children to older adults, whereas a vast majority of basketball players are teenagers and young adults,” he said.\n“In short, it was determined by everyone involved in the process that the broad appeal of pickleball would reach a lot more Fort Lauderdale residents than basketball. Plain and simple, nothing nefarious.”\nTate said protesters using race as an argument to preserve the basketball courts were creating a false narrative and “selfishly trying to divide a great city”. The Guardian’s question about it was “irresponsible”, he added.\n“The people who play basketball and people who play pickleball are all the same in my book. [Protesters] who are trying to insinuate that one sport is only played by one race, that is absurd,” he said.\n“I love basketball. I played basketball my entire childhood. I admire those who can still play.”\nTate said it would be impossible to change the agreement for the pickleball courts, but that the development board set up to oversee the project recognized many people still wanted to play basketball on the beach, and had “offered a suggestion to the city which they are now exploring, with diligence”.\n“If things work out as suggested, then everyone should be happy,” he said.",

    "title": "Graham Potter: Premier League breaks record for most sackings in a single season",
    "text": "It was just six months ago that Graham Potter was deemed the man to usher in a fresh, exciting era at Chelsea.\nThe club’s new ownership group, led by American businessman Todd Boehly, had enticed Potter away from Brighton with the promise of managing one of the most lucrative teams in world soccer.\nMore than $600 million was spent on bringing big-name players to the club and Potter, one of the most exciting young managers in the Premier League, was to mold them into a winning machine.\nBut, on Sunday, the club announced that it had sacked its manager after an underwhelming spell in charge.\nPotter managed to win just 10 of the 28 league matches this season and leaves the team 11th in the Premier League table.\nIn recent weeks, players had looked a shadow of their former selves and many fans had lost confidence that Potter’s plan for the club could ever work.\nEventually, after previously sticking by its manager, Blues ownership agreed.\n“On behalf of everyone at the club, we want to thank Graham sincerely for his contribution to Chelsea,” the club’s co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali said in a statement.\n“We have the highest degree of respect for Graham as a coach and as a person. He has always conducted himself with professionalism and integrity and we are all disappointed in this outcome.”\nIn his previous role as Brighton manager, Potter was given time to stamp his identity on the squad.\nThe club was punching above its weight financially and, as a result, carefully selected new signings which would compliment Potter’s style of play.\nThe approach paid off as the team became an established Premier League outfit which has gone on to greater things this season – the Seagulls currently sit sixth in the league and in the UEFA Conference League qualification spot.\nAt Chelsea, it seemed the complete opposite.\nAs was the case under previous owner Roman Abramovich, the club expected instant results and used its financial weight to sign a number of high-profile names, including the likes of Enzo Fernández and Mykhailo Mudryk.\nDespite his impressive CV, Potter had never managed superstars and suddenly found himself in a changing room with multiple.\nThe scatter gun approach to recruitment also left the team lacking balance and organization with Potter failing to get a tune out of a team busting with talent.\nPremier League record\nIn truth, many had raised an eyebrow when Potter, inexperienced at the very top level, was chosen to replace Thomas Tuchel as manager.\nDespite falling out of favor with fans by the end of his tenure, Tuchel had guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021 and is still considered by many as one of the best coaches in the world.\nThe German has gone on to sign with Bavarian giant Bayern Munich through the 2024/25 season and recently told reporters he needed “quite a bit of time to distance himself from Chelsea” because leaving the club had hurt him.\n“Todd [Boehly] said he would be different to Roman [Abramovich],” former Liverpool player and current pundit Jamie Carragher wrote on Twitter.\n“I feel for Graham Potter, but it was inevitable. You don’t change Tuchel for Potter. Ridiculous decision to start with.”\nWith 10 games left in the league and a Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid on the horizon, Chelsea still has plenty to play for.\nAssistant coach Bruno Saltor will take over on an interim basis, but Boehly and his team must now look for a long-term replacement capable – and willing – to bring order to Chelsea’s chaos.\nPotter’s sacking is yet another sign of just how transient managers can be in the top-flight of English football, especially when results aren’t instantaneous.\nThere has now been a record 12 sackings in the Premier League so far this season, with Potter leaving his position the same day Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers was sacked from his.\nThe previous record was 10 manager changes in a single season, set in four other campaigns, most recently in 2017/18.",

    "text": "How a park ranger alerted world to Sycamore Gap tree's fate\n2 days ago\nMartin Lindsay\nSenior Investigations Reporter\nDaniel Graham and Adam Carruthers have been found guilty of cutting down the iconic Sycamore Gap tree. The deliberate felling of the tree on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland angered people around the world. For the man who was first on the scene, it was a moment that changed his life forever.\nPark ranger Gary Pickles was in shock.\nWhere once had stood arguably England's favourite tree, there was now just air.\nWhen the call had come through earlier that morning, Gary had thought it was a prank.\nHis working day on 28 September 2023 had barely started when a farmer called his office to report the tree was down.\n\"I doubted a farmer would be telling us a silly story so I thought 'oh my god, I think this might be true'.\"\nThe team of park rangers were alerted by email and Gary got in his van to drive to the tree.\nWith every passing minute of the short journey, his anxiety levels increased.\n\"As I got nearer and nearer, I just thought 'it's gone, it's gone'.\"\nHe'd arrived at the road adjacent to the tree and had to \"double take\" as he saw it for the first time lying on its side.\n\"It was shock,\" said Gary, who was met with a gaping hole in the landscape.\nAt this stage, he presumed the tree had been damaged in Storm Agnes, which had brought strong winds overnight.\n\"When you look and it's gone, it's just....oh my god,\" he said.\n\"It's a landmark. It's a piece of the landscape.\"\nGary needed to investigate further. He parked his van in a nearby car park and rushed on foot to the fallen tree.\nThe sadness he was feeling soon turned to anger and panic.\n\"When I got there I realised it had been chopped down and not blown down.\n\"There was a clean cut so that escalated it up.\n\"Once you realise it's been chopped down, then it's going to become a massive worldwide story.\"\nThe seriousness of the developing situation quickly became apparent.\nGary hastily reported back to Northumberland National Park's headquarters that it appeared that the tree had been cut down deliberately. At this stage there was no time to consider who by or why.\nJust after 09:00 BST, the National Park alerted colleagues at the National Trust, including general manager Andrew Poad.\n\"My personal phone started lighting up. Messages were coming through on my laptop.\n\"Once I realised it was a deliberate act, crisis mode kicked in,\" said Andrew, whose priority was to personally inform people before they saw it on social media.\n\"It was like ringing people up to tell them that someone had passed away.\n\"On the day I was using the expression 'it's like losing a loved one'. We all went through that grief.\n\"There were numerous members of staff in tears.\"\nViral photographs shared on social media showed the tree on its side, as the PR teams at the National Park and the National Trust frantically collaborated on an official response.\n\"Within the hour it was global, effectively,\" Andrew said.\nShortly before 11:00, a statement from the organisations confirmed the tree had been cut down.\nAt around midday, Northumbria Police announced it was being treated as \"a deliberate act of vandalism\".\nLocal journalists were already carrying out interviews at the scene, before reporters from around the world turned the grassy mound opposite the stump into a \"sea of camera tripods\".\n\"It is the largest press story that the National Trust has ever dealt with,\" Andrew said.\n\"It was one of the things that surprised us. The sheer scale of the global reach of the interest really took us back a bit.\"\nThe usual calming sound of the vast countryside was drowned out by the clicks of cameras and the engines of broadcast trucks.\n\"We knew it was popular, but we didn't know how popular,\" Andrew said.\nThe international interest also surprised Gary.\n\"My sister lives in France, my brother is in America, and by dinner time they'd both rung me, so it was global news at such a fast rate.\"\nSenior management from the National Park and the National Trust spent the afternoon at the fallen tree, speaking to the crowds of emotional walkers and journalists.\nReporters gathered shocking footage of the trunk draped over a now damaged Hadrian's Wall.\nThis idyllic, tranquil spot that had brought peace to so many was now a crime scene wrapped in blue and white police tape. Forensic officers in white suits also gathered DNA from the stump.\nEighteen months on from its felling, Andrew and Gary regularly reflect on the day that north-east England lost \"a massive local landmark\".\n\"It's just senseless. Who or what were they trying to get at?\" Andrew said.\n\"It's still a huge part of my life dealing with this. It's a big gap in all our lives, never mind the landscape.\"\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.",

    "title": "‘The New Big 5’: Wildlife photography book turns the lens on animals at risk",
    "text": "Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\nOriginally a term used by trophy hunters in Africa, the “Big Five” described the animals most challenging to shoot and kill: the lion, elephant, leopard, rhino, and buffalo. Nowadays, it is more loosely used to refer to some of Africa’s largest and most iconic animals.\nHowever, British photographer Graeme Green has reclaimed the narrative, creating a global “New Big Five” for wildlife photography. In 2021, 50,000 people around the world voted for the five animals they would most like to photograph, or see photographed, in the wild. Five animals were crowned the winners: the elephant, polar bear, lion, gorilla and tiger.\nThis week, sees the publication of “The New Big 5” photography book, which features images of those animals and other at-risk wildlife, from photography legends such as Ami Vitale, Steve McCurry and Paul Nicklen, and essays from famous conservationists and activists including like Jane Goodall and Paula Kahumbu.\nGreen says that the book celebrates wildlife and is a global call to action on issues impacting wildlife, including habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.\nAnimals at risk\nGreen was on assignment in Botswana at least a decade ago when he came up with the idea for a project to encourage people to “shoot with a camera, not a gun,” he says.\n“I thought this would be a way to get people really focusing on wildlife, thinking about the wildlife they love, thinking about the animals that are at risk.”\nIn total, the book includes the work of 144 globally renowned wildlife photographers from Ecuador to India. Curating the images took nearly two years of work, says Green.\n“I think these are some of the most beautiful and creative images that I’ve seen put together in one book,” says Green. “These are the species that we are at risk of losing.”\nAccording to the UN, nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, with around one million of the planet’s animal and plant species facing extinction. The “New Big 5,” all of which are threatened, act as ambassadors for what is happening in the natural world, says Green.\nAs well as being a powerful reminder of what we stand to lose, the book also points people towards potential solutions. Featured essays explore the benefits of rewilding and the importance of indigenous communities in conservation.\nA chapter on endangered species from bees to blue whales illustrates the alarming threat climate change poses to animals outside of the “New Big 5.” “That’s only the tip of the iceberg – I could have included thousands of pictures because that’s how serious the situation is,” says Green.\nJane Goodall, a leading conservationist who also wrote the afterword to the book, said in a press release that “we have a window of time during which we can start to heal some of the harm we have inflicted on the natural world, but only if we get together and take action now.\n“I hope the photos will lead people into the wonderful worlds of these iconic species. Then, perhaps, other people will become involved in helping to create a world where wildlife can flourish for future generations to enjoy,” she said.\n“The New Big 5: A Global Photography Project For Endangered Wildlife,” by Graeme Green, published by Earth Aware Editions, is on sale from April 4, 2023.",

    "text": "Paris Saint-Germain’s miserable season went from bad to worse on Sunday as the team suffered a second straight home defeat with a 1-0 loss to Lyon.\nEven before the game kicked off, Lionel Messi bore the brunt of the frustrations of some PSG fans who whistled when his name appeared on the big screen during the announcement of the starting lineup.\nAfter Alexadre Lacazette missed a first-half penalty, Bradley Barcola’s goal 10 minutes into the second period was enough to earn Lyon the three points on a night that PSG rarely looked like threatening the visiting goal.\nLens’ 1-0 victory over Rennes and Marseille’s 1-1 draw with Montepellier means both teams are now just six points behind PSG at the top of Ligue 1, and even the domestic title may slip from the team’s grasp.\nThe reaction of some fans on Sunday must have felt a world away from the adulation and worship Messi received during his recent return to Argentina for friendlies against Panama and Curaçao as the country continued its World Cup celebrations.\nMessi’s arrival at the Parc des Princes was supposed to be the missing piece that would help PSG finally win the Champions League, the trophy the club’s Qatari owners crave the most.\nSo far, the only major trophy the team has won since Messi joined was Ligue 1 last season, a title – it’s fair to say – PSG would likely have won without him.\nMessi has 34 goal contributions in all competitions for PSG this season – 18 goals and 17 assists – second only to Mbappé’s 38 and head coach Christophe Galtier refused to lay the blame for the team’s failures at the Argentine’s feet.\n“I found it [the jeering] hard to listen to,” Galtier told reporters, per the Athletic. “There may be expectations for Messi and Mbappe to unlock difficult situations. Messi tries very hard, they didn’t all work out; but around him, the other players also need to do their jobs.”\n“We can’t expect everything from Leo and Kylian,” he added.\nUp next for PSG is a season-defining week as Galtier’s side travels to a Nice team that is unbeaten in 13 matches, before hosting Lens at the Parc des Princes.\nPSG has lost two of its three matches since being dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich last month, and only limped past relegation-threatened Brest with a 90th minute Kylian Mbappé winner.\nAfter his team’s victory, Lyon head coach Laurent Blanc said the Champions League or bust mentality has been detrimental to PSG’s performances.\n“Paris’ problem is when the No. 1 objective of the Champions League is no longer accessible, it seems that the season no longer exists – and at all levels,” he told reporters.",

    "title": "Angel Reese defends gesture directed towards Caitlin Clark after LSU national title win; calls out double standard after being ‘unapologetically’ her",
    "text": "LSU star Angel Reese defended the gesture she aimed at Iowa Hawkeyes’ Caitlin Clark near the end of the Tigers’ first NCAA women’s basketball national championship victory on Sunday, saying “I don’t take disrespect lightly.”\nReese could be seen approaching Clark before moving her open hand in front of her face – popularized by WWE star John Cena to mean “you can’t see me” – before pointing to her ring finger in a gesture some interpreted as a reference to the place her newly-acquired championship ring might sit.\nClark made a similar gesture to another player earlier in the tournament.\nThe gesture has sparked much debate, especially on social media. Some have criticized Reese, while others have defended her actions, highlighting how there was no public outrage in response to Clark’s gesture earlier in the tournament.\nSports journalist Jose de Jesus Ortiz called Reese’s actions “classless,” while former ESPN host Keith Olbermann called Reese an “idiot” for the gesture.\nIn the press conference after the victory, Reese referenced the difference in reaction she received as a result of her gesture as compared to the one Clark received.\n“All year, I was critiqued for who I was. I don’t fit the narrative,” Reese said. “I don’t fit the box that y’all want me to be in. I’m too hood. I’m too ghetto. Y’all told me that all year. But when other people do it, and y’all don’t say nothing.\n“So this is for the girls that look like me. For those that want to speak up for what they believe in. It’s unapologetically you. And that’s what I did it for tonight. It was bigger than me tonight. And Twitter is going to go into a rage every time.\n“And I’m happy. I feel like I’ve helped grow women’s basketball this year. (…) I’m looking forward to celebrating and then next season.”\nReese had 15 points and 10 rebounds in the 102-85 victory and won the women’s March Madness’ Most Outstanding Player award.\nIn the post-game broadcast, Reese referenced the similar gesture Clark made to a Louisville opponent in the Elite Eight.\nIn the same game, Clark said to an opponent: “You’re down by 15 points. Shut up,” according to the Bleacher Report.\n“Caitlin Clark is a hell of a player but I don’t take disrespect lightly,” Reese said. “She disrespected [LSU’s] Alexis [Morris] (…) and I wanted to pick her pocket. But I had a moment at the end of her game. I was in my bag, I was in my moment.”\nAfter the Championship game, Clark herself said she didn’t notice anything at the time.\n“I was just trying to get to the handshake line and shake hands and be grateful that my team was in that position,” Clark said in the post-game press conference. “All the credit in the world to LSU. They were tremendous. They deserve it. They had a tremendous season.\n“(LSU head coach) Kim Mulkey coached them so, so well. She’s one of the best basketball coaches of all time, and it shows. She only said really kind things to me in the handshake line, so I’m very grateful of that too.\n“But honestly I have no idea. I was just trying to spend the last few moments on the court with especially the five people that I’ve started 93 games with and relishing every second of that.”\nLSU head coach Mulkey said she had “no clue” about what transpired.\nAmong those defending Reese on social media were ESPN’s Holly Rowe and former NBA star Etan Thomas.\n“People hating on Angel Reese or Caitlin Clark. Stop. Unapologetically confident young women should be celebrated NOT hated. Get used to it,” Rowe wrote on Twitter.\nFormer Washington Wizards, Oklahoma City Thunder and Atlanta Hawks player Thomas wrote: “Hold on now!!!! It was cute when Caitlin Clark did it. Y’all didn’t have any issues with it at all. So don’t be all outraged and talking about class and sportsmanship when Angel Reese does the same thing. We’re not doing double standards here.”\nReese said the negative reaction on social media throughout the season has helped fuel her excellent season, having finished averaging 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds in her first season with LSU after transferring from Maryland.\n“Twitter can say what they want to say,” she said. “I love reading those comments. I have all the screenshots of what everybody has said about me all season. What are you going to say now?”",

    "title": "Artemis II: The 4 astronauts NASA picked for moon mission",
    "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nAstronauts who will helm the first crewed moon mission in five decades were revealed on Monday, queuing up the quartet to begin training for the historic Artemis II lunar flyby that is set to take off in November 2024.\nThe astronauts are NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency.\nWiseman is a 47-year-old decorated naval aviator and test pilot who was first selected to be a NASA astronaut in 2009. A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment.\nWiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.\nHansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.\nHe will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.\nGlover is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.\n“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”\nGlover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.\nGlover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.\nKoch, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the first all-female spacewalk in 2019. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.\nAbout this mission\nThe Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an uncrewed test mission that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.\nIf all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\nThe journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.\nThe “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.\nAfter circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.\nArtemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.\nThe Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including spacesuits for walking on the moon and a lunar lander to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.\nNASA is targeting a 2025 launch date for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to 2026 or later.\nThe space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.\nPicking the astronauts\nVanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the selection process. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.\n“I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on inaugural missions.\nKoch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.\n“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”\nShe said the offer rendered her “speechless.”\n“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”\nAn interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.",

    "title": "Autism: Study finds slightly higher risk of diagnosis in areas with more lithium in drinking water, but experts say more research is needed",
    "text": "A new study found a moderately higher risk of autism spectrum disorder in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with higher levels of lithium, but experts caution that this association does not show a direct link between the two.\nAbout 1 in 36 children in the US is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) each year, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nScientists still don’t know the exact cause of autism, a developmental disorder. Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too.\nCases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. One study published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. A 2021 report found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to more doctors screening for the condition.\nLithium is an alkali metal that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It’s used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, according to the US Geological Survey.\nA new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems.\nThe researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation.\nAs lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure.\nThe researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe.\nExperts say it’s important to note that the research can’t show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis.\nFurther study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\n“Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,” Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection.\nThe implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with health benefits such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide.\n“If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,” wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. “Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations.”\nDr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies – which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water – do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder.\n“It’s an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,” said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. “We have to see if there’s a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD.”\nOther studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, air pollution and phthalates. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder.\nA link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it’s just the populations who live in more polluted areas.\n“There’s a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?” Wiznitzer said. “We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that’s high on our list.”",

    "text": "US ambassador to UN describes Russia running the UNSC as an \"April Fool's joke\"\nThe US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield on Monday described Russia assuming the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency this month as “an April Fool’s joke.”\nGreenfield said she is not surprised if the Russians asked the foreign minister to come to UNSC headquarters in New York but also said council does work beyond Ukraine.\n“We haven’t decided yet on what our attendance levels will be, but we intend to carry out the business of the Security Council during this month. The Security Council does more than Ukraine. We work on many issues, and we again expect that Russia will carry their presidency in a professional way, but when they don’t, we will stand ready to call them out,” Greenfield said.\nNewly published video shows moment of explosion that killed Russian blogger\nNewly published video shows the moments running up to an explosion that killed Russian military journalist Vladen Tartovsky in a St Petersburg café on Sunday.\nTatarsky died when a blast tore through the cafe where he was appearing as a guest of a pro-war group called Cyber Front Z. Prior Russian media reports suggested that Tatarsky may have been killed by a device hidden in a figurine presented to him by a woman before the blast.\nThe 25-second video shows Tartovsky putting a statuette given to him at the event into a box after passing the microphone to another man.\nHe places the statuette back into the box and then covers it with what appears to be paper wrapping. As he presses down the paper, there is an explosion.\nIn the last two seconds of the video, Tartovsky is pixillated, but the rest of the scene is not.\nMore to know: The well-known Russian blogger was killed in what appeared to be an audacious attack on a high-profile pro-Kremlin figure, officials said.\nAuthorities said they were treating the case as suspected murder.\nAt least 32 people were injured in the blast, with 10 people in serious condition, state media Ria Novosti reported, citing the Russian Ministry of Health.\nRussia's UN ambassador derides suggestion country cannot hold UNSC presidency during Ukraine war\nRussian ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya on Monday scoffed at concerns that his country could fairly be the president of the Security Council for April during the war in Ukraine.\nNebenzya pointed out that the US was president of the council in 2003 — the year Iraq was invaded.\nHe said there were no complaints in February 2022 when Russia was last president of the council, while Russia invaded.\nThe ambassador said as long as world order is maintained, there will not be any change in UN procedures that might lead to a change in Russia’s status.\nRussia took over presidency on Saturday of the UN’s top security body, which rotates every month.\nNATO says it has not seen any changes in Russia's nuclear posture since Belarus announcement\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance has not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture since Russian President Vladimir Putin announced late last month Moscow’s plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus.\nStoltenberg described Putin’s announcement as a “pattern of dangerous, reckless nuclear rhetoric.”\n“President Putin tries to use nuclear weapons as a way to prevent us from supporting Ukraine… intimidation, coercion to stop NATO Allies and partners for supporting Ukraine in their right to defend their own country,” he said.\nUkrainian military says dozens of enemy attacks along the front lines have been repelled\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said.\nUkraine war has cost $2.6 billion in damage to heritage and cultural sites, UNESCO says\nThe war in Ukraine has cost an estimated $2.6 billion of damage to heritage and cultural sites in the country, the UN cultural body UNESCO said in a recently published report.\nThe report, which covers one year of war in Ukraine between February 24, 2022, and February 24, 2023, was a joint assessment conducted by the Ukrainian government, the World Bank, the European Commission, and the United Nations.\nUNESCO was in charge of the part of the report dedicated to culture and tourism.\nSome $1.7 billion of that cost was distributed to “historic cities, buildings, and sites imbued with recognized cultural/social values,” $650 million to tourism facilities, $143 million to “movable cultural properties and collections, repositories of culture,” and $150 million to “buildings/workshops/ateliers dedicated to cultural and creative industries,” according to UNESCO.\nThe most impacted region in Ukraine was Kharkivska, which has suffered 30% of the total damage to its cultural assets, the report added.\nUNESCO said that losses are estimated at around $15.2 billion, which includes revenue losses from tourism, art, sports, entertainment, recreation, cultural education, and creative and cultural industries.\nUNESCO’s head Audrey Azoulay is currently in Ukraine, the organization told CNN on Monday.\nFinland's official accession to NATO is historic, alliance chief says\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said it will be historic when the military alliance raises the Finnish flag for the first time at its headquarters on Tuesday.\n“It will be a good day for Finland’s security, for Nordic security, and for NATO as a whole,” Stoltenberg added.\nFinland is set to become a member of the alliance on Tuesday, with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö traveling to Brussels to attend an accession ceremony at NATO headquarters.\nStoltenberg also spoke about Sweden’s bid to join NATO, saying Finland’s accession is “in itself something we should celebrate” but is also good for Sweden.\n“It makes Sweden more integrated into NATO and makes Sweden even more safer,” Stoltenberg said, adding “at the same time we celebrate and enjoy that Finland is now full-fledged member, we should continue work to finalize the Swedish accession process.”\nCNN’s Laurent Kent contributed to this report.\nUN nuclear agency chief will travel to Russia on Wednesday\nThe head of the United Nations nuclear agency, International Atomic Energy Agency, will travel to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad in the Baltics Wednesday to discuss the safety of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN.\n“IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi will visit Kaliningrad on Wednesday as part of his ongoing consultations aimed at ensuring the protection of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant during the military conflict,” the spokesperson said Monday.\nThe plant has been occupied by Russian forces since March of last year and is now run by the Russian atomic agency, Rosatom.\nThe situation at the nuclear plant has not improved, according to the IAEA chief, who visited the facility last week and cited increased military activity in the area.\nGrossi during the visit said he was trying to formulate “realistic, viable proposals” that would be acceptable to both sides.\nCafe where St. Petersburg blast occurred linked to Wagner boss\nWagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said Monday that he “gave” the St. Petersburg cafe, where an explosion killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky on Sunday, to the Cyber Front Z group, which hosted an event at the cafe.\nWhen asked to confirm whether he was the owner of the cafe, Prigozhin didn’t deny it, in comments published Monday by his holding company Concord on its VK social media page.\n“Indeed, I gave the cafe to the patriotic movement Cyber Front Z, and they held various seminars there,” Prigozhin said.\nRussia’s independent news outlet Fontanka is reporting that the cafe belongs to Prigozhin, on the basis of the Concord company’s ownership mentioned on the cafe’s receipt.\nPrigozhin is the founder and sole owner of Concord, according to public records.\nCNN has not been able to independently verify Prigozhin’s claims and whether he is the legal owner of the cafe.\nIn the same post, Prigozhin is also commenting on who may be behind the blast.\n“I do not know the details of the incident now, I was only informed that, unfortunately, Vladlen Tatarsky died. I don’t know about the rest of the details,” Prigozhin said.\n“Most likely, this tragedy happened at the seminar. As for the death of Darya Dugina, yes, everything is similar,” he said referencing the death of the daughter of ultra-nationalist philosopher Alexander Dugin, who was killed by a car bomb on the outskirts of Moscow last year.\n“But I would not blame the Kyiv regime for these actions. I think that there is a group of radicals that is hardly related to the government. That’s what I would call it,” Prigozhin said.\nWall Street Journal reporter appeals against his arrest in Russia\nWall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has filed an appeal against his arrest, according to the Russian state news agency TASS.\nThe agency cited the press service of the Lefortovo court in Moscow, where he was taken into custody last week.\n“The court received a complaint from Gershkovich’s defense against the choice of a preventive measure in the form of detention,” TASS reported.\nNo date for hearing the appeal has been set.\nGershkovich is currently being held in a pre-trial detention center at the notorious Lefortovo prison until May 29. He faces up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges.\nIt is the first time an American journalist has been detained on accusations by Moscow of spying since the Cold War.\nUkrainians deride Wagner chief's claim that Russian forces hold Bakhmut\nUkrainian officials have dismissed the claim made Sunday by Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin that “in legal terms” Russian forces hold the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut.\nPrigozhin made the claim while raising a Russian flag in Bakhmut in honor of the murdered military journalist Vladlen Tatarsky. He said the flag was being raised at the site of the council building. Video later surfaced of a flag being raised amid some rubble.\nSerhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the Eastern Grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told CNN that “all administrative buildings in Bakhmut have been destroyed. I don’t even know which one he was talking about.”\nBy contrast, the official said Ukrainian forces only raised the flag once enemy units are expelled and stabilization measures are undertaken.\nCherevatyi said that a significant part of Bakhmut remains completely under the control of the Ukrainian defense forces, so this is “just more wishful thinking” on Prigozhin’s part.\n“We are able to deliver everything we need there, including ammunition, medicine, food, and to take the wounded out of there,” he told CNN, adding that “the situation is very difficult but under our control and there are no signs of a systemic breakthrough or any significant operational success.”\nThe Russians failed to surround Bakhmut and made no battlefield breakthroughs while still suffering heavy losses, Cherevatyi said.\n“Over the past 24 hours alone, 154 occupiers were killed in the Bakhmut sector, primarily Wagner fighters, 144 were wounded, and one was taken prisoner,” the official said.\nChervatyi said that so far Wagner’s units continue to be the main Russian striking force in Bakhmut, but “because of significant losses, they are unable to act entirely on their own in this area today…We can see that airborne troops and motorized infantry units are being deployed.”\nHe said the Wagner chief tried to create the illusion of self-sufficiency, but had failed.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also spoke about the battlefield Monday, alluding to the expectation that Ukrainian forces might soon launch a counteroffensive.\nNATO chief calls for \"immediate release\" of US journalist arrested in Russia\nNATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called for the “immediate release” of US national Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested in Russia on spying charges last Friday.\n“I join the United States in their call on Russia to release the American journalist Evan Gershkovich,” Stoltenberg said in a news conference Monday. “His arrest is of concern. It is important to respect freedom of the press, the rights of journalists, and the rights to ask questions and to do their jobs. Therefore, we call on his immediate release.”\nRussian authorities detained Gershkovich last week and accused him of spying, signaling a significant ratcheting of both Moscow’s tensions with the United States and its campaign against foreign news media, which has been under intense pressure since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. The Wall Street Journal categorically rejected those allegations, saying in a statement that it “vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter.”\nHusband of St. Petersburg blast suspect says she was \"set up\"\nThe husband of the woman alleged to have carried out the bombing that killed a prominent Russian military journalist on Sunday has said he is convinced she was “set up.”\nDmitry Rylov told independent Russian publication The Insider that his wife had been detained at the apartment of a friend, who was also arrested.\n“She was really just set up and used. Over the last day I contacted her, but I lost contact about four to five hours ago,” Rylov, who is not in Russia, told The Insider at the time of the interview.\nDaria Trepova was detained on Monday in connection with the explosion at a cafe in St. Petersburg, which killed prominent military journalist Vladlen Tatarsky and injured at least 32 others.\nSpeaking of the event during which the explosion occurred, Rylov said: “All I knew was that Daria needed, either for some task, or for some reason, to give some gift, I didn’t even know what.”\n“There is one very important point that she told me several times: She was sure that this thing would allow access to a person. That is, it was not something that should have exploded,” he said.\n“Dasha [Daria], in principle, is not the kind of person who could kill anyone,” added Rylov.\n“Daria said that she was set up, and I completely agree: No one expected this. As far as I know, it was necessary to hand over this figurine, in which there was something … We talked about this at least twice. Daria would not be able to do this,” he told The Insider.\nGerman vice chancellor arrives in Kyiv to signal the belief that Ukraine \"will be victorious\" and \"rebuilt\"\nGerman Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck arrived in Kyiv on Monday, accompanied by a business delegation, to discuss rebuilding Ukraine from the war with Russia.\n“The purpose of this trip is to give Ukraine a clear sign that we believe that it will be victorious, that it will be rebuilt, that there is an interest from Europe not only to support in times of need, but also that Ukraine will be an economically strong partner in the future,” Habeck told journalists upon arrival in Kyiv.\nThis is his first visit to Kyiv since the beginning of Russia’s war in Ukraine over a year ago.\nRussia claims suspect in St. Petersburg explosion worked with Ukrainians\nRussia claims the explosion that killed military journalist Vladlen Tatarsky on Sunday involved agents of the Ukrainian special services and associates of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.\n“The terrorist act committed on April 2 in St. Petersburg against the well-known journalist Vladlen Tatarsky was planned by the special services of Ukraine with the involvement of agents from among persons collaborating with the so-called Anti-Corruption Fund of Navalny, of which the detained Daria Trepova is an active supporter,” Russia’s National Anti Terrorism Committee (NAC) said Monday in a statement carried by state media outlet RIA Novosti.\nEarlier Monday, the Russian interior ministry announced Trepova’s arrest in connection with the explosion, which injured at least 32 people.\nUkraine has said little about the attack, beyond blaming in-fighting in Russia. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian President’s office, wrote on Twitter on Sunday evening: “Spiders are eating each other in a jar. Question of when domestic terrorism would become an instrument of internal political fight was a matter of time.”\nSome context: Tatarsky was one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers, known for his ardent pro-war commentary and occasional criticism of Moscow’s battlefront failures.\nHis hardline views in support of the war were unremittingly hostile towards Ukraine, and made little distinction between civilian and military targets.\nTatarsky gained prominence after attending a Kremlin ceremony that marked the annexation of four Ukrainian regions — a move dismissed as illegal under international law by Ukraine and Western allies.\n“I congratulate everyone, everyone who waited till this moment. We will defeat everyone, we will kill everyone, we will rob everyone we need. Everything will be as we like,” he said in September.\nRussian-appointed official injured in car bomb in Melitopol, says Ukrainian mayor\nA Russian-appointed official was injured in a car explosion in the Ukrainian city of Melitopol on Monday, the Ukrainian mayor of the city, Ivan Fedorov, said in a Telegram post.\nThe injured person, Maksym Zubarev, is reportedly the head of the Russian-occupied Yakymivka community, located about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southwest of Melitopol, Fedorov said.\nAccording to Ukraine’s Security Service, Zubarev was among the organizers of pseudo-referendums in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.\nIn September, four Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine staged votes on joining Russia. The polls, which are contrary to international law, paved the way for Russian annexation of the areas.\nSome context: The occupied city of Melitopol is a hub for Russian forces nearly 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the front lines.\nLast week, Ukrainian forces shelled the city causing power supply suspensions and damaging railway infrastructure.\nPoland has delivered \"several\" MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine\nPoland has already delivered “several” MiG-29 fighter aircraft to Ukraine, the Polish president’s foreign affairs adviser Marcin Przydacz said Monday during an interview with Polish radio RMF FM.\nPoland announced it would send the aircraft, which were about to be decommissioned by the country’s air force, on March 16.\n“When it comes to the MI-29 aircraft, which are still operating in the defense of Polish airspace, a decision has been taken at the highest levels, we can say confidently that we are sending MiGs to Ukraine,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said at the time.\n“We have a dozen or so MiGs that we got in the ’90s handed down from the German Democratic Republic and they are functional and play a part in the defense of our airspace. They are at the end of their operational life but are still functional,” he added.\n“We will replace them with deliveries of `south Korean FA-50s and American F-35s,” said Duda.\nUkraine has long pushed for deliveries of fighter jets from its allies. So far only Poland and Slovakia, which has promised to deliver 13 MiG-29 fighter jets, have answered that call.\nSome context: Warsaw has taken the lead among NATO allies in supplying Kyiv with heavy weapons, and Poland had been one of the most vocal European nations against Russia – even before the invasion of Ukraine.\nRussia is still seen by many in Poland’s political and diplomatic circles in a Cold War context. Russian President Vladimir Putin has always been seen by Warsaw as untrustworthy and Russian expansion is something to be fought against at all costs.\nZelensky says situation in Bakhmut is \"especially hot,\" after Wagner boss claims Russian forces have \"taken\" city\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the Ukrainian military for defending the country, particularly Bakhmut, after fresh claims that the embattled eastern city had fallen to Russian forces.\n“I am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut … Especially Bakhmut. It’s especially hot there today,” Zelensky said in his evening address Sunday, without elaborating further on the situation in Bakhmut.\nWagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed in a short video published Sunday that “in legal terms, Bakhmut has been taken. The enemy is concentrated in the western districts.”\nIn its operational update Sunday, the Ukrainian military said Russian forces continued to storm Bakhmut but Ukrainian forces were “bravely holding the city and repelling numerous enemy attacks.”\nThere is no independent evidence to suggest that Wagner now holds Bakhmut. However, its fighters are inside the city limits, as they have been for several weeks.\nSome background: On March 28, the Commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that their main task in Bakhmut was to “deplete the enemy’s overwhelming forces and inflict heavy losses on it.”\n“We are now at a time when the enemy, trying to capture Bakhmut, has thrown all its best units in to achieve victory,” said Syrskyi.\n“Our task is to destroy as many enemies as possible and create the conditions for us to launch an offensive.”\nSuspect detained over St. Petersburg cafe blast, Russian authorities say\nA suspect has been detained in connection with the explosion that killed ultranationalist military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky at a cafe in St. Petersburg on Sunday, the Investigative Committee of Russia has said.\nEarlier, Daria Trepova had been added to a Russian wanted list as a suspect in connection with the explosion, which injured at least 32 people, state media reported.\nWhat we know about deceased Russian blogger Vladlen Tatarsky\nVladlen Tatarsky, who was killed in an explosion at a cafe in St. Petersburg on Sunday, was one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers, known for his ardent pro-war commentary and occasional criticism of Moscow’s battlefront failures.\nHis hardline views in support of the war were unremittingly hostile towards Ukraine, and made little distinction between civilian and military targets. At one point, he wrote: “At least a little distracted from constantly thinking how can we quickly kill all the enemies.”\nHe made perhaps his most infamous remark last September from inside the Kremlin, as the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian regions was sealed.\nTatarsky’s real name was Maxim Fomin, but he borrowed his alias from the protagonist of the novel “Generation ‘P,” by Russian author Victor Pelevin.\nThe character is a failed poet who becomes an ad writer. The novel is set in the early years of Boris Yeltsin’s time as Russian leader and is meant to be a criticism on the corruption and consumerism of the era.\nWhile an enthusiastic supporter of the Russian invasion, Tatarsky was among a small but influential group of military bloggers sometimes critical of the way the campaign was conducted. Tatarsky later told CNN that he was not criticizing the entirety of what the Kremlin continues to call Russia’s “special military operation” but “individual episodes,” and he still believed Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine.\nRead more about Tatarsky here.\nGerman Vice Chancellor arrives in Kyiv with business delegation\nGermany’s Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Monday.\nHabeck is being accompanied by a business delegation.\nThis is the vice chancellor’s first visit to Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian war against Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\nSome context: Modern Germany has been reluctant to become involved in international conflicts against the backdrop of post-WWII demilitarization, but the country has adopted an evolving approach to security and military policy in the wake of Moscow’s war on Ukraine.\nAfter months of hesitation, the German government announced in January that it would answer Kyiv’s calls for the high-tech Leopard 2 tanks.\nNumber of injured in St. Petersburg blast rises to 32, Russian news agency says\nThe number of those injured in an explosion at a St. Petersburg café on Sunday has risen to 32, according to Russian state media Ria Novosti, citing the Russian Ministry of Health.\nPreviously, officials had reported the number of injured was 30.\nAmong those wounded, ten are in a serious condition, state media reports.\nSome context: The explosion killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, according to Russian state news agency TASS and local authorities. Tatarsky died when the blast tore through the cafe where he was appearing as a guest of a pro-war group called Cyber Front Z, which was hosting a regular event. Authorities said they were treating the case as suspected murder.\nHere's what to know about Sunday's explosion in St. Petersburg\nA well-known Russian military blogger was killed in an explosion at a cafe in St. Petersburg on Sunday, officials said, in what appeared to be an audacious attack on a high-profile pro-Kremlin figure.\nHere’s what you need to know.\nWhat happened: The explosion killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky and injured at least 30 other people, according to Russian state news agency TASS and local authorities. Tatarsky died when the blast tore through the cafe where he was appearing as a guest of a pro-war group called Cyber Front Z, which was hosting a regular event. Authorities said they were treating the case as suspected murder.\nWhat caused the blast: Russian media reports suggested that Tatarsky may have been killed by a device hidden in a figurine presented to him by a woman before the blast. Russian state news media, citing law enforcement agencies and eyewitness accounts, said the woman was attending the event at which Tatarsky was speaking. Russian authorities have not yet commented on the reports and CNN is not able to independently verify the claim.\nWho is behind the attack: No evidence has yet been presented about who carried out the attack. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova pointed the finger at Ukraine, without citing evidence. Zakharova said it was an example of growing threats against Russian journalists on the part of the Ukrainian government. Meanwhile, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukraine President’s office suggested the killing was due to in-fighting in Russia.\nWho was the Russian blogger: Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was among several prominent bloggers who have amassed a large following for their coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine on online platforms like Telegram. Tatarsky created his Telegram channel in 2019 and had more than half a million followers. In 2014, Tatarsky took part in fighting alongside Russian forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, according to Russian state news agency Vesti, citing public sources, when Putin’s fighters first invaded the country. While Tatarsky was ardently pro-war, he also sometimes issued criticism of setbacks in Moscow’s campaign — a fairly rare phenomenon in the Russian public sphere.\nWagner group chief says Russian flag raised in Bakhmut to honor deceased Russian blogger\nThe head of Russia’s Wagner private military group said they raised a Russian flag over the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut on Sunday in memory of Vladlen Tatarsky, a prominent Russian military blogger who died Sunday following an explosion at a cafe in St. Petersburg.\nThe video was purportedly from Bakhmut, but CNN could not immediately confirm the location where Prigozhin recorded the message, holding a flag that was indistinct in the darkness.\nIn the short video Prigozhin also claimed, “In legal terms, Bakhmut has been taken.”\n“The enemy is concentrated in the western districts,” he added.\nThe Ukrainian military pushed back on those claims in its Sunday operational note, saying that “the enemy continues to storm Bakhmut. However, our defenders are bravely holding the city and repelling numerous enemy attacks.”\nThere is no independent evidence to suggest that Wagner now holds Bakhmut, but its fighters are inside the city limits, as they have been for several weeks.\n30 people injured in St. Petersburg blast, Russian news agency says\nThe number of people wounded in Sunday’s explosion at a cafe in St. Petersburg, Russia, has increased to 30.",

    "text": "The University of Connecticut won its fifth men’s basketball national title with a 76-59 victory over San Diego State University on Monday night at NRG Stadium in Houston.\nSenior guard Tristen Newton led UConn (31-8) with 19 points and 10 rebounds while Final Four Most Outstanding Player Adama Sanogo, a junior forward, chipped in with 17 points and 10 rebounds.\n“We weren’t ranked going into the year so we had the chip on our shoulder,” UConn head coach Dan Hurley told game broadcaster CBS. “We knew the level that we could play at, even through those dark times,” he added, referencing the team’s six losses in eight games during the regular season.\nHe said going into the tournament his group had confidence garnered during the season.\n“And when you have the type of leaders like Andre Jackson (game-high six assists Monday) and Adama Sanogo, they kept this team together, got us back on track and we knew we were the best team in the tournament going in and we just had to play to our level,” he added.\nSan Diego State (32-7) was topped by Keshad Johnson who had 14 points.\nUConn trailed very early but San Diego State was undone by an 11-minute, eight-second stretch in which they scored just five free throws and missed 12 consecutive shots from the field. The Huskies went from down 10-6 to up 36-24 at halftime.\nThe Aztecs made a run midway through the second half and narrowed the deficit to five at 60-55 with 5:19 to play but the Huskies scored the next nine to take a comfortable lead into the final two minutes.\n“We battled. Battled back to five in the second half, but gave them too much separation,” San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. “We had to be at our best. We weren’t at our best. A lot had to do with UConn.”\nSenior guard Adam Seiko told reporters they gave themselves a chance with their second half comeback but UConn “just made a little bit more plays” at the end.\n“They have a lot of weapons. They were pretty good,” said Matt Bradley, also a senior guard. “To beat them, we had to make shots. I shot poorly. And you had to have a really good game to beat those dudes on the offensive end.”\nUConn won each of its six tournament games by at least 10 points, with its closest game being a 13-point win over the University of Miami in the national semifinals.\n“I just want to thank my teammates, my coaches who believed in me. If it were not for them I would not be here right now,” Sanogo told CBS.\nJordan Hawkins, who scored 16 points for UConn, talked about winning the crown one day after his cousin, Angel Reese of Louisiana State University, won the women’s title.\n“I mean it’s absolutely amazing that we both get this opportunity and I mean the family reunion is going to be great so that’s all I know,” he said.\nUConn enters rarefied air as only the sixth team to win five NCAA men’s basketball championships, joining UCLA (11), Kentucky (eight), North Carolina (six), Duke (five) and Indiana (five). All of UConn’s titles have come since 1999 with the most recent before Monday occurring in 2014.\nUConn’s women’s teams have won 11 basketball national titles.",

    "title": "Are we heading for another world war - or has it already started?",
    "text": "In a week in which former allies in a redividing globe separately commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, the sense of a runaway descent towards a third world war draws ever closer.\nThe implosion of Pax Americana, the interconnectedness of conflicts, the new willingness to resort to unbridled state-sponsored violence and the irrelevance of the institutions of the rules-based order have all been on brutal display this week. From Kashmir to Khan Younis, Hodeidah, Port Sudan and Kursk, the only sound is of explosions, and the only lesson is that the old rules no longer apply.\nIndeed Fiona Hill, the policy analyst and adviser to the UK government on its imminent strategic defence review, argues the third world war has already started, if only we would recognise it.\nThe fear of a world in which no one, due to science or globalisation, is any longer in control is hardly new: the concept was the title of two Reith lectures, one in 1967 by the social anthropologist Edmund Leach and another in 1999 by the political philosopher Anthony Giddens. But rarely has been it so clear that the rules-based world order created in 1945 is in headlong retreat.\nThe former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband put it well this week at Chatham House, saying: “I know that people always say the world is changing, but this feels like a moment of genuine geopolitical flux, at least as significant as 1989-90 when the world transitioned from the cold war to a unipolar moment, and for me the Trump administration is both symptom and cause of the changes under way.\n“The problem is that it’s much more clear what we are inflecting from – a world in which the US was the anchor of the global system – but it’s not clear what we’re inflecting to. I know there’s a lot of talk about the idea of a multipolar world reflecting a redistribution of the balance of power, but I find that concept conveying too much stability, too much security.”\nHis one-time mentor Tony Blair, in a talk in California, argued: “Everyone has been shaken out of their comfort zone. The noise you are hearing from the political undergrowth is the frantic foraging for options. People are rethinking their position in the world and their relationships. There is no doubt at all this is a major shock. This is the most significant geostrategic event I can remember in terms of America and the world.”\nFor the former US secretary of state Antony Blinken, Donald Trump’s indifference to alienating allies is an act of vandalism. He said diplomats around the world were asking: “What the fuck is going on?”\nBlinken said America had spent 80 years building up trust, strong economic partnerships and military and political alliances, and if that was then taken down in a matter of 100 days it would be incredibly hard to rebuild.\n“It means countries look for ways to work around us, to work together but without the US,” he said. “The possibility that what will be said today will be reversed tomorrow, and will be reversed again, means they simply cannot count on us. Joe Biden used to say it is never a good idea to bet against America. The problem we now have is people are no longer betting on America.”\nTrampling on the rules\nThe doleful consequences of America’s withdrawal have been visible all week. It may or may not be a world war but it is a world at war.\nIn Gaza the world has watched as a blockade on food, aid and medical supplies, in defiance of binding orders by the international court of justice (ICJ), has now entered into its third month. Israel, in search of security, has in the past month bombed Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. It is daily urging the US to be given permission to bomb Iran.\nTrump can hardly complain when Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s ultra-right finance minister, shared his vision for the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, predicting that within half a year the population of the territory would be confined to just a narrow swathe of land, with the remainder “totally destroyed”. Smotrich was only repeating a version of Trump’s plan to empty Gaza of Palestinians, a plan totally at odds with the ceasefire terms his envoy had negotiated.\nIn remarks at a “settlements conference”, Smotrich also declared that Israel would “apply sovereignty” in the West Bank within the lifetime of the current government, which is due to expire in October 2026 unless elections are called earlier. “Within a few months, we will be able to declare that we have won. Gaza will be totally destroyed,” Smotrich said. “In another six months, Hamas won’t exist as a functioning entity.”\nWith Trump silent, it was left to Europe to respond. “It is time for the European Union and the entire international community to wake up,” said the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot. He denounced the blockade as “an absolute disgrace … It is not acceptable; deliberately cutting off all humanitarian aid, all access to food, healthcare, electricity and water, as a war strategy, is totally unacceptable.”\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “If we condemn Russia for violating Ukrainian sovereignty, we cannot remain silent when it happens in Gaza. Hamas must be fought, yes, but not at the cost of trampling on all the rules.”\nHe called for a united response by Europe, yet at a foreign affairs meeting in Poland the 27 ministers could not even agree on a joint statement, let alone joint action to suspend its free trade agreement with Israel, a Dutch proposal.\nMeanwhile in Port Sudan, the conduit for humanitarian aid into Sudan, Rapid Support Forces drones destroyed infrastructure, just as Israeli bombs have sought to do this week in Hodeidah, the chief entry point for aid into Yemen.\nOn Monday an effort by the Sudanese government to hold the United Arab Emirates accountable at the ICJ for directing arms to the RSF ended in failure. The UAE, like many other nations, is a signatory to the genocide convention, but it has entered a reservation insisting its compliance with the convention is not subject to ICJ proceedings. The ICJ meekly concluded there was a manifest lack of jurisdiction. Only one judge, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf from Somali, objected.\nSo the UAE gains kudos of signing the convention without needing to be judged on meeting its obligations. It has been left to the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to make a valiant effort to coax the parties to a ceasefire, but so far it has foundered. The US, by contrast, labels RSF leaders as genocidal but does nothing in practical diplomatic terms.\nIn Kashmir, where two nuclear-armed states are firing rockets at one another’s aircraft, there is a conspicuous absence of American interest. The US has no ambassador in India or Pakistan and no senior state department official appointed. The conflict is not making waves in US media, and Trump’s initial response was “it’s a shame” and that “if you think about it they have been fighting for many, many decades, and centuries, actually”.\nIn previous disputes between India and Pakistan it took a decisive US intervention to help calm both sides. In July 1999 in Washington, Bill Clinton personally browbeat Pakistan’s then leader, Nawaz Sharif, into retreat in what one official called the most important meeting with a foreign leader of Clinton’s presidency.\nThe former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo revealed in his memoir how close the two sides came in February 2019 to a nuclear conflagration, something he frantically helped stop from a secure hotel room on a visit to Hanoi. Unnervingly, India is no longer framing the issue as terrorism but as a state-on-state dispute by saying the underlying issue is Pakistan acting as a shield for terrorism.\nA decent betrayal\nThese conflicts may be disconnected save the common thread of absent US leadership and permanent upheaval. But in Ukraine the structural elements of the world war come together, Hill argues. The scale of the death toll may be different to the second world war, but according to the UK military this week Russia has suffered 900,000 casualties, far in excess of its losses during previous wars in Chechyna and Afghanistan.\nMoreover, the wars are now, in her words, “system-changing conflicts with multivector loads of countries involved”. Chinese-flagged trawlers with Russians onboard rupturing undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is only one part of Vladimir Putin’s global war.\nChina, North Korea and Iran are all supporting Russia, some in more material ways such as building drone factories or supplying soldiers. A host of other countries have been happy to keep Russia economically afloat in ways that make their neutrality contestable. India, with which the UK has completed a free trade deal this week, has bought €112bn of oil from Russia since the war started, and also bought Russian arms.\nThe conflict has been presented by Russia and its allies as a war about American hegemony. Trump clearly had a plan to extricate the US from the line of fire and to put relations with Russia on a different footing, a desire he has nursed since the 1980s. Trump sees the world in similar terms to Putin – a handful of sovereign powers dividing up land into spheres of influence. His dream is to re-enact Yalta 1945 alongside Putin and possibly Xi Jinping, with Europe an onlooker and Ukraine dismembered. But organising a decent betrayal has proved more difficult than expected.\nIn the White House, Trump famously told Volodymyr Zelenskyy: “You have to be thankful. You don’t have the cards.” But Trump overplayed the cards he had, throwing many of them away with his self-destructive tariff war. And it emerged that Zelenskyy did in fact have a few cards left, deploying them skilfully by offering a 30-day ceasefire, a minerals deal with the US, and focusing on Ukraine’s military value to western security.\nThe intimate photo of Trump and Zelenskyy in conclave at the funeral of the pope (a picture taken by Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak) reeked of reconciliation yet flattered Trump’s ego. A change in mood in Washington is now discernible. Even JD Vance, the vice-president, once agitator-in-chief against Zelenskyy, this week admitted Russia was “asking for too much” and said Europe and the US were “on the same team”.\nEurope’s leaders would dearly welcome that, but there is now a clarity across Europe, and not just in Paris, that regardless of Vance’s reassurance, Europe has to have the capability to operate autonomously of the US. Trump is self-evidently not reliable, and his benign assessment of Putin’s intentions is not shared.\nPlanning for a European reassurance force in Ukraine is under way, as is planning for a potential Russian attack on Europe. Since February, France and the UK, through a combined joint expeditionary force, have formed the nucleus of that planning, but this has broadened, with new political leadership increasingly coming from four members of the Weimar+ group: Poland, France, Germany and the UK.\nIn a speech marking VE Day, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, explained the double necessity for Europe to be prepared for war. Russia’s war of aggression had shattered the European security order, with the imperial delusion that the war in Ukraine could be conflated with the great patriotic war. Then he added: “The fact that now even the United States, who did so much to create and shape this order, is turning its back on it is a shock on an entirely new scale. That is why I speak of a double epochal shift – Russia’s war of aggression and the US break with its values – that is what marks the end of this long 20th century.”\nEurope, he insisted, must decide what comes next.",

We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause and advise passengers to check the status of their flights with their airlines before travelling to the airport.\n“We hope to have all systems fully resolved soon and will provide another update shortly.”\nA spokesperson for Stansted told PA Media: “All systems have now been fully restored and no flights have been cancelled as a result of the IT issue. We are investigating the cause of the earlier issue so nothing confirmed at this stage but, for background, it looks like it was related to internet access for some systems.”\nOne passenger who missed his Ryanair flight to Rome told the Guardian: “I got there two hours before [my flight] just after 6am.

    "title": "Public funding for royals triples since 2012 because of Palace works",
    "text": "11 hours ago\nSean Coughlan\nRoyal correspondent\nPublic funding for the Royal Household has tripled in real terms since 2012, official figures show, with the rise driven largely by repairs and building work at Buckingham Palace.\nThe Sovereign Grant, which provides state funding for the monarchy, was introduced in 2012 at £31m per year. That has now risen to £132m, data from the House of Commons Library shows, and once inflation has been taken into account, that represents about a threefold increase.\nThe grant rose 53% in April, from £86.3m to £132.1m. Royal aides say this was because of a Buckingham Palace building project and the grant will come down again, adding that the monarchy represents good value.\nLord Turnbull, a crossbench peer and a former Cabinet Secretary, called the way the grant was calculated \"complete and utter nonsense\" but said that the budget isn't high compared with other presidential heads of state.\nThe Sovereign Grant provides funding for the official duties of the monarchy. In the most recent figures, for 2023-24, the biggest items were property maintenance and staff payroll, with smaller amounts for travel and hospitality and housekeeping.\nThe analysis by the House of Commons Library shows how much the Sovereign Grant has risen over time - using a measure that takes into account inflation, with comparisons using 2023-24 values as a benchmark.\nUsing that measure, the Sovereign Grant in 2012-13 was worth £41.5m – which rose to almost £100m in 2018-19, to cover renovations in Buckingham Palace, and then rose in 2025-26 to being worth £129.3m, again for work on Buckingham Palace.\nA Bank of England inflation calculation also shows the grant's value having trebled since 2012, although Buckingham Palace uses a separate figure which is slightly below a threefold real-terms increase.\nBuckingham Palace says the current figures are higher because of a 10-year, £369m project to modernise facilities in the Palace, including cabling, plumbing, wiring and lifts. It's a project that the National Audit Office says has been well-run and delivers \"good value for money\".\nThe Palace says it's misleading to compare this year's figures with earlier levels of grants. They say the big increase is due to the element of the grant that pays for Buckingham Palace building works, rather than the \"core\" grant for other running costs.\n\"The Sovereign Grant remained virtually flat for five years from 2020, during a period of high inflation. The majority of the increase in this year's Sovereign Grant is to fund the Buckingham Palace Reservicing Programme, which is ensuring that the Palace, a national asset, is accessible and protected from fire and flood,\" said a Palace spokesperson.\n\"A temporary increase in the grant across two years was approved to provide the remainder of the funding agreed in 2016 for this reservicing work. It has always been anticipated that the level of the Sovereign Grant will drop once the project is completed,\" said the spokesperson.\nThis could mean funding from the public purse reducing after 2027.\nThe sharp increase over the past decade has been during difficult years for public finances, including periods of austerity and tight controls over budgets.\nFor example, a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that public spending on education in England went down by 11% in real terms between 2010-11 and 2023-24, although the IFS says that it is difficult to compare such big multi-billion budgets with changes in relatively smaller amounts such as the Sovereign Grant.\nBefore the Sovereign Grant was introduced, state funding for the monarchy came through a mix of grants, government department spending and a \"civil list\" payment.\nFigures from the House of Commons Library, going back to 1995, show the pre-Sovereign Grant totals as lower than than they are today - for instance, using 2023-24 values, it was worth £67m in 2000 and £56m in 2005.\nThe Sovereign Grant was introduced as a more \"modern, transparent\" way of bringing together royal funding, presented to MPs in 2011 as being likely to reduce the royal income.\nThe grant is based on a percentage of the profits of the independent property and landowning business, the Crown Estate. The grant is not from the Crown Estate, it comes from the Treasury, but the Crown Estate is used as a benchmark.\nSovereign Grant was initially set at 15% of Crown Estate profits, which rose to 25% to cover the cost of renovating Buckingham Palace.\nIt's now being reduced to 12%. But because of increased profits for the Crown Estate from selling leases for offshore wind farms, the actual cash amount has risen sharply, because it's a percentage based on a much bigger total.\nThe increase in the Sovereign Grant's value is blamed by former Lib Dem Home Office minister Norman Baker, a prominent critic of royal finances, on what he calls the \"completely absurd\" way it's calculated and \"weak-kneed\" governments that don't want to challenge it.\n\"The Royal Family has been very efficient in persuading the public purse to keep coughing up more money,\" he says.\n\"Buckingham Palace has been used again and again to justify the increases.\n\"We're told public finances are tight, we can't afford a winter fuel allowance, but we can pay for an increase for the Royal Family. It's completely wrong.\"\nLord Turnbull, a former Cabinet Secretary and Permanent Secretary at the Treasury in the 1990s and 2000s, is also critical of the way the grant is calculated. He says successive governments have used the Crown Estate calculation as a convenient way of avoiding debate and stopping a \"lot of bolshy backbenchers moaning about the cost of the monarchy\".\nHe says it would be much better to have a straightforward grant to pay for the monarchy, which could be debated on its own merits.\nBut he also says it's a \"red herring\" to focus on the headline increase in the Sovereign Grant, when that figure has been driven by work to preserve Buckingham Palace, rather than underlying running costs. He says that if you have a monarchy it has to be properly funded. \"You either have one or you don't,\" says Lord Turnbull.\nPauline Maclaran, a royal commentator from Royal Holloway, University of London, says the monarchy \"generates a great deal of money and goodwill.\"\nThis is often seen in terms of boosting tourism and promoting business links, but Prof Maclaran says increasingly it needs to recognise the impact of royal \"soft power\".\nUS President Trump is a self-professed fan of King Charles and if those warm feelings helped with UK and US trade and tariff negotiations the benefits would hugely outweigh any annual costs of the monarchy, says Prof Maclaran.\nBut the royals can't be immune to questions about finances, she says: \"The public wants to know if they're of value.\"\nRoyal expert Richard Palmer says this year's increase has \"raised eyebrows\".\n\"Of course the head of state and those who support him need to be funded properly, but so do other parts of the state - the health service, schools, the military, for example,\" says Mr Palmer.\nRoyal sources say there is transparency and funding is subject to the approval of Parliament. The Royal Trustees overseeing the grant are the prime minister, chancellor and the keeper of the privy purse, who looks after the monarch's finances.\nYou can dig into the accounts and see from 2023-24 that the royals spent over £1m on helicopter flights, there was an electricity bill of £2.2m and that travel for the Duke of Kent over three days to attend regimental events in Scotland cost more than £23,000.\nThere are also details of what the monarchy provides in a year – including hosting 400 events, inviting 105,000 guests to receptions, garden parties and official lunches. There were also 2,300 public engagements, supporting charities and good causes.\nThere are national and international events, including state visits which help to promote UK trade. There's a constitutional role, such as the state opening of Parliament and regular meetings with the prime minister.\nRepublic, a group campaigning for an elected head of state, have argued that other costs need to be included, such as security, which is not covered by the Sovereign Grant.\nThey also want the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall to count as public funding, rather than private incomes for the King and Prince of Wales. A report from the group claims that the total cost of the monarchy is about £510m per year.\nOpinion polls suggest the monarchy remains popular, with a YouGov survey in February 2025 suggesting 55% viewed the monarchy positively compared with 36% who saw it negatively.\nBut there is less certainty about funding. Another YouGov survey in December 2024 suggested strong public opposition to government money being spent on Buckingham Palace – by 56% to 29%.\nAnd there are divisions by age groups – with 74% of the over-65s thinking the royals are good value for money, compared with 44% of 25 to 49 year olds.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "title": "Putin proposes direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul on May 15",
    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, “without preconditions” to achieve “lasting peace” and “eliminate the root causes” of the three-year conflict.\nThe offer, delivered early on Sunday, came hours after the leaders of Ukraine, France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom called for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.\nThe leaders, who were meeting in Kyiv, said their call is backed by United States President Donald Trump and threatened “massive” new sanctions on Moscow if it did not agree with their plan.\nPutin, however, rejected that proposal, slamming European “ultimatums” and “anti-Russian rhetoric”, before outlining the counter-proposal for renewed Russia-Ukraine negotiations.\n“We are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,” the Russian president told reporters. “We offer the Kyiv authorities to resume negotiations already on Thursday, in Istanbul.”\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday told Russian and French leaders that a “historic turning point” has been reached in efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war and that Ankara was ready to host talks between the two warring parties, his office said.\nNATO member Turkey has sought to maintain good relations with both of its Black Sea neighbours since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and has twice hosted talks aimed at ending the war.\nUS President Donald Trump described the talks offer a “potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine”.\n“I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens. The USA wants to focus, instead, on Rebuilding and Trade. A BIG week upcoming!” he added.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday welcomed Russia’s offer for direct peace talks a “positive sign,”, adding that “the entire world has been waiting for this for a very long time.”\n“There is no point in continuing the killing even for a single day. We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire – full, lasting, and reliable – starting tomorrow, May 12th, and Ukraine is ready to meet,” he posted on X.\n‘No preconditions’\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has left hundreds of thousands of soldiers dead and triggered the gravest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.\nIn the first weeks of the conflict, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators held direct talks in Istanbul, but failed to agree to halt the fighting.\nPutin said Russia was proposing restarting the talks in an attempt to “eliminate the root causes of the conflict” and “to achieve the restoration of a long-term, lasting peace” rather than simply a pause for rearmament.\n“We do not exclude that during these talks we will be able to agree on some new ceasefire,” he added.\nPutin, whose forces have advanced over the past year, has faced increased public and private pressure from Trump as well as warnings from European powers to end the war.\nBut he has offered few concessions and has stood firm in his conditions for ending the war.\nIn June 2024, Putin said Ukraine must officially drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed by Russia.\nRussian officials have also proposed that the US recognise Russia’s control over about one-fifth of Ukraine and demanded that Ukraine remain neutral, though Moscow has said it is not opposed to Kyiv’s ambitions to join the European Union.\nPutin specifically mentioned the 2022 draft deal from the talks in Istanbul.\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, that draft deal stipulated that Ukraine should agree to permanent neutrality in return for international security guarantees from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: China, France, Russia, the UK and the US.\n“It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv,” Putin said.\n“Russia is ready to negotiate without any preconditions.”\nRussia, Putin added, had proposed several ceasefires, including a moratorium on striking energy facilities, an Easter ceasefire, and most recently, the 72-hour truce during the celebrations marking 80 years since victory in World War II, but accused Ukraine of repeatedly violating the ceasefires.\nHe said that during the May ceasefire, Ukraine had attacked Russia with 524 aerial drones, 45 sea drones, a number of Western missiles and that Russia had repelled five attacks on Russian regions.\nUkraine, too, has accused Russia of repeatedly violating its own ceasefire.\nTrump factor\nAnatol Lieven, the director of the Eurasia Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told Al Jazeera that both sides were trying to blame each other for failing to agree to a ceasefire deal amid pressure from Trump to end the war.\n“Trump has threatened to walk away from the peace process if there isn’t some kind of settlement or agreement on a ceasefire soon. And the question is, who he blames for the failure? If he blames the Russians more, then full US aid will continue to Ukraine, and the sanctions he has threatened will be intensified,” said Lieven.\n“If, however, he blames Ukraine more, then, as he’s done once before, he will suspend US aid and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, and that, of course, will drastically weaken Ukraine’s military position and strengthen that of Russia. So both sides are manoeuvring to try to throw blame for any failure onto the other.”\nEarlier on Saturday, the leaders of France, Germany, Poland and the UK travelled together to Ukraine for the first time, in a visit that Zelenskyy said sent “a very important signal”.\nThe five leaders held a meeting in Kyiv and issued a statement calling for a ceasefire “lasting at least 30 days” from Monday, to make room for a diplomatic push to end the war.\n“An unconditional ceasefire by definition cannot be subject to any conditions. If Russia calls for such conditions, this can only be considered as an effort to prolong the war and undermine diplomacy,” the statement read.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said the US would take the lead in monitoring the proposed ceasefire, with support from European countries, and threatened “massive sanctions … prepared and coordinated between Europeans and Americans” should Russia violate the truce.\nMeanwhile, retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, said on Saturday that a “comprehensive” 30-day ceasefire, covering attacks from the air, land, sea and on infrastructure, “will start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II”.\nTrump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly said he wants to end the “bloodbath” of the Ukraine war, which his administration casts as a proxy war between the US and Russia.\nFormer US President Joe Biden, Western European leaders and Ukraine portray the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and have repeatedly pledged to defeat Russian forces.\nPutin meanwhile casts the war as a watershed moment in Moscow’s relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.",

    "text": "From 5h ago\nRussia launches drone attack on Ukraine despite Putin's call for talks\nDespite Vladimir Putin’s call for so-called peace talks, Russia on Sunday launched a drone attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine, injuring one person in the region surrounding the capital and damaging several private homes, Ukrainian officials said.\nThe attack began around 2am this morning, with Russian forces launching 108 drones (including decoys) from multiple directions, Ukraine’s air force said.\nUkrainian air defence systems had shot down 60 drones launched across the eastern, northern, southern, and central regions of Ukraine as of 09.30am, the country’s air force said.\nAnother 41 drones were reportedly lost from radar but did not cause damage.\nThere were no immediate reports of any casualties but Ukraine’s air force said that the Sumy region – which borders on Russia’s Kursk region – suffered as a result of the Russian attack, without elaboration.\nShare\nKey events\nShow key events only\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\nSummary of the day so far...\nIt is approaching 3pm in Kyiv. Here is a roundup of the main events so far today:\nRussian president Vladimir Putin proposed direct talks with Ukraine on 15 May in Istanbul to achieve what he claims could be “the restoration of a long-term, lasting peace” if certain conditions are met. Putin said he wants to address what he calls “the root causes of the conflict”.\nIn response, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia’s consideration of ending the war is a “positive sign” and that Ukraine is open to direct talks with Russia later this week, but only if Moscow signs up to an unconditional ceasefire first.\nEuropean leaders from the UK, France, Germany and Poland demanded on Saturday in Kyiv that Putin agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting tomorrow or face “massive” new sanctions. Putin has dismissed what he said was the attempt by some European powers to lay down “ultimatums”.\nFrance’s president, Emmanuel Macron, responded to Putin’s proposal for direct talks by saying there can be no proper negotiations while “civilians are being bombed”. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Russia’s offer to negotiate directly with Ukraine is “a good sign” but “far from sufficient”.\nDespite Putin’s call for so-called peace talks, Russia on Sunday launched a drone attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine, injuring one person in the region surrounding the capital and damaging several private homes, according to officials.\nYou can read more on the latest developments from Ukraine in this story.\nShare\nUpdated at 13.02 BST\nPoland’s prime minister Donald Tusk is the latest to respond to Vladimir Putin’s proposal for direct talks with Ukraine.\nWriting in a post on X, Tusk, who was with other European leaders in Kyiv on Saturday, said:\nIn response to our appeal, the Russians have proposed peace talks starting May 15.\nThe world, however, іs waiting for univocal decision on an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine is ready. No more victims!\nShare\nGerman chancellor says Russian proposal for Ukraine talks is 'far from sufficient'\nThe new German chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Sunday that Russia’s offer to negotiate directly with Ukraine is “a good sign” but “far from sufficient”.\n“We expect Moscow to agree to a ceasefire that allows real talks to take place. First the weapons must be silenced, then the discussions can begin,” he said in a statement carried by the Agence France-Presse news agency.\nMerz, who was confirmed as chancellor after a shaky start on Tuesday, has promised to put staunch support of Ukraine at the heart of his government amid persistent concerns over US security commitments to Europe under Donald Trump.\nAs the Guardian’s Europe correspondent, Jon Henley, notes in this story, Merz is more open than his predecessor Olaf Scholz to sending German long-range missiles to Ukraine and to deploying German troops as part of a peacekeeping force.\nHe joined the UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk in Kyiv on Saturday where they met Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a show of support for Ukraine.\nShare\nTurkish president says 'historic turning point' has been reached in efforts to end the war\nNato member Turkey, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has positioned itself as a potential mediator in the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nIt has maintained cordial ties with both sides and has voiced support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and provided it with military help, while opposing western sanctions on Russia.\nErdoğan on Sunday told his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron that a “historic turning point” had been reached in efforts to end the war, according to the Turkish president’s office.\nIn a phone call, Erdoğan was quoted as having told Macron:\nA historic turning point has been reached in efforts to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, that this opportunity must be seized, and that Turkey is ready to provide all kinds of support, including hosting negotiations, to achieve a ceasefire and lasting peace.\nAs a reminder, Russian president Vladimir Putin said the proposed talks with Ukraine – to “solve the root causes of the conflict” - should be held in the Turkish city of Istanbul on 15 May, as they have been before.\nShare\nUpdated at 11.59 BST\nPope Leo XIV calls for 'authentic, just and lasting' peace in Ukraine in first Sunday message\nPope Leo XIV has given his first Sunday message to crowds in St. Peter’s Square in Vatican City since his election as pontiff last week.\nThe new pope called for an “authentic and lasting peace” in Ukraine and a ceasefire in Gaza and release of all Israeli hostages. Leo called on the world’s major powers for “no more war”.\nHe said he carries in his heart the “suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine” and appealed for negotiations to reach an “authentic, just and lasting peace”, carrying on the tradition of the late Pope Francis who had called for talks between Ukraine and Russia to end the war and repeatedly condemned the senseless deaths of civilians.\nShare\nUpdated at 12.00 BST\nRussia officially resumes war in Ukraine after conclusion of three-day 'truce'\nRussia says its soldiers are continuing with their “special military operation” – what the Kremlin calls the full-scale invasion of Ukraine - now that the three-day ceasefire has ended (see post at 10.08 for more details on this temporary truce).\nRussian forces have slowly increased the size of territory they control over the past year, making incremental battlefield gains mostly in the east of Ukraine.\nShare\nUpdated at 11.45 BST\nOn Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day had killed three residents and injured four more.\nAnother civilian died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin.\nAn Associated Press tally, based on reports from Ukrainian authorities, found at least 117 civilians had been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Russian aerial attacks since Ukraine announced on 11 March its willingness for a ceasefire.\nShare\nUpdated at 11.46 BST\nWestern leaders have repeatedly cast Vladimir Putin as untrustworthy, pointing to past ceasefire violations and broken promises.\nIn mid April the Russian leader announced a 30 hour “Easter truce” ceasefire, claiming he had ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” along the frontline during this window for “humanitarian reasons”.\nWhile the ceasefire did see a decrease in fighting, there were claims of hundreds of breaches from both sides.\nAt the time, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of creating a mere “impression” of a ceasefire as Moscow continued shelling areas of Ukraine.\nShare\nHere is a video of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, proposing restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on 15 May.\nShortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched in February 2022, Turkey hosted unsuccessful talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators aimed at ending the fighting.\nThe proposed deal reportedly included provisions for Ukraine’s neutral status and put limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks on the status of Russian-occupied areas.\nMoscow has blamed Kyiv and the west for the talks collapsing.\nShare\nUpdated at 10.36 BST\nAccording to the Tass state news agency, the Russian defence ministry said that Ukraine violated the three-day truce, which ended on Saturday, more than 14,000 times, and that Kyiv’s troops had made five attempts to breach Russia’s southern border.\nOn Thursday, the first day of the ceasefire, Ukraine accused Russia of more than 730 violations and said its forces would respond accordingly.\nWe have not yet been able to independently verify any of the violation figures given by either side.\nShare\nUpdated at 10.36 BST\nAndriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, has said Kyiv expects Russia to confirm it will abide by the US-backed 30-day ceasefire, starting on Monday, before meeting for talks later in the week.\nFirst there has to a ceasefire “then everything else”, Yermak posted on Telegram.\n“Russia should not disguise its desire to continue the war with vague statements,” he added.\nSaturday’s visit by European leaders to Kyiv, where the unconditional 30-day ceasefire was proposed, came on the last day of a three-day truce in the war, which was declared by Moscow. The temporary ceasefire coincided with the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war.\nKyiv said it was designed to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia during celebrations marking the Soviet victory in the second world war, which were held in Moscow on Friday.\nFighting did reportedly decrease between the 8-10 May period, but both Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of breaking the ceasefire.\nShare\nUpdated at 10.37 BST\nRussia launches drone attack on Ukraine despite Putin's call for talks\nDespite Vladimir Putin’s call for so-called peace talks, Russia on Sunday launched a drone attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine, injuring one person in the region surrounding the capital and damaging several private homes, Ukrainian officials said.\nThe attack began around 2am this morning, with Russian forces launching 108 drones (including decoys) from multiple directions, Ukraine’s air force said.\nUkrainian air defence systems had shot down 60 drones launched across the eastern, northern, southern, and central regions of Ukraine as of 09.30am, the country’s air force said.\nAnother 41 drones were reportedly lost from radar but did not cause damage.\nThere were no immediate reports of any casualties but Ukraine’s air force said that the Sumy region – which borders on Russia’s Kursk region – suffered as a result of the Russian attack, without elaboration.\nShare\n'There can be no dialogue while civilians are being bombed' - Macron\nFrance’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has responded to Vladimir Putin’s proposal in a post on X this morning.\nHe wrote:\nIn Kyiv and alongside President Trump, we made a clear proposal: an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting on Monday. President Zelenskyy committed without setting any condition. We now expect an equally clear response from Russia.\nThere can be no negotiations while weapons are speaking. There can be no dialogue if, at the same time, civilians are being bombed. A ceasefire is needed now, so that talks can begin. For peace.\nMacron, a staunch supporter of Kyiv, has said previously that any peace deal must “not be a surrender of Ukraine” and must be backed up by security guarantees.\nShare\nUpdated at 09.26 BST\nVladimir Putin’s proposal for “direct talks” with Kyiv came hours after leaders from the UK, France, Germany and Poland travelled to Kyiv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nAs my colleague Shaun Walker notes in this story, the European leaders told the Russian president to sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers to Ukraine.\nThey said the ceasefire proposal was supported by Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day.\nFrance’s president Emmanuel Macron said that the US would take the lead in monitoring the proposed ceasefire, with support from European countries, and threatened “massive sanctions ... prepared and coordinated, between Europeans and Americans” should Russia violate the truce.\nAt a joint press conference, the UK’s prime minister Keir Starmer said the leaders were demanding “an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and [are] clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond”.\nPutin rejected the calls for a ceasefire, but said he was ready for direct negotiations with Ukraine.\nShare\nUpdated at 09.25 BST\nZelenskyy says it is 'positive sign' Russia is considering ending the war\nUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has just welcomed Vladimir Putin’s proposal for direct talks in Istanbul on Thursday, but said his team is expecting Moscow to agree to a “lasting” ceasefire starting tomorrow.\nIn a post on X, Zelenskyy, without responding explicitly to Putin’s invitation for talks in Turkey, wrote:\nIt is a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war.\nThe entire world has been waiting for this for a very long time. And the very first step in truly ending any war is a ceasefire. There is no point in continuing the killing even for a single day.\nWe expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire – full, lasting, and reliable – starting tomorrow, May 12th, and Ukraine is ready to meet.\nShare\nPutin calls for 'direct talks' with Ukraine after rejecting ceasefire ultimatum proposed by European leaders\nWelcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine.\nVladimir Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine on 15 May in Istanbul to achieve what he claims could be “the restoration of a long-term, lasting peace” if certain conditions are met.\nIn a rare televised late-night address from the Kremlin, the Russian president said he wants to address what he calls “the root causes of the conflict”, which will likely include demands that Ukraine will never join Nato.\n“We are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,” the Russian leader said.\nPutin said that he would speak to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan later on Sunday about facilitating the talks.\n“Our proposal, as they say, is on the table. The decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their curators, who are guided, it seems, by their personal political ambitions, and not by the interests of their peoples.”\nUkraine has not yet commented on Putin’s proposal but Donald Trump, whom Kyiv is reliant upon for military aid, said this could be a “potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine”, as he vows to “continue to work with both sides”.\nPutin put forward the late night proposal after European leaders threatened Moscow with fresh sanctions if Russia failed to comply with an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting tomorrow. He dismissed what he said was the attempt by some European powers to lay down “ultimatums”.\nMoscow demanded yesterday that the west must stop arming Kyiv before any ceasefire can start, which would leave Ukraine in an extremely vulnerable position and likely lead to more Russian advances on the battlefield.\nAnalysts say that Putin is not serious about peace talks and will not agree to a ceasefire.\nThey see his latest proposal as a way for him to appear serious about peace to Washington but drive a further wedge between the Trump administration, which wants to bring a quick end to the war, and Kyiv, which will look inflexible if it rejects maximalist positions demanded by Moscow the Kremlin knew it would not accept.\nShare",

    "title": "UFC 315: Della Maddalena defeats Muhammad in welterweight title fight",
    "text": "Jack Della Maddalena took away Belal Muhammad’s potent wrestling ability, allowing only one takedown en route to becoming the new welterweight champion in the main event of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) 315 in Montreal, Canada.\nHe won the five-rounder by scores of 48-47, 48-47, 49-45 on Saturday night.\nDella Maddalena used volume striking to frustrate the now-former welterweight champion, nearly finishing the fight on several occasions. Della Maddalena (18-2, Mixed Martial Arts) has now won 18 in a row. Muhammad (24-4, 1 No Contest) was making his first title defence and had won 11 consecutive fights.\nDella Maddalena credited Muhammad’s toughness but said post-fight that he knew he was not going to let it slip away.\n“It felt [expletive] good,” the Australian said with a smile.\nHe said he was intrigued by UFC lightweight champion Islam Makhachev’s possible move to welterweight, and was open to exacting revenge on the Russian. His fellow Australian, Alexander Volkanovski, lost both bouts to Makhachev.\nIt is the first loss for Muhammad, a Chicago native, since January 2019.\nValentina Shevchenko successfully defended her UFC women’s flyweight title in the co-main event over Manon Fiorot, winning by a unanimous 48-47, 48-47, 48-47 decision to hand Fiorot (12-2, MMA) her first UFC loss.\nDespite a closely contested fight, Shevchenko (25-4, 1 NC MMA) pushed the pace in the fourth and fifth rounds to tire out Fiorot and give the Frenchwoman little room to work after signs of early success through three gruelling rounds.\n“I expected a hard fight,” Shevchenko, a 125-pounder from Kyrgyzstan, said in the Octagon following the win.\nThe victory marked Shevchenko’s 14th in the UFC, including 10 title fights.\nInitially scheduled as a bantamweight fight, Canadian featherweight Aiemann Zahabi earned a win by unanimous decision against former UFC featherweight champion Jose Aldo, taking the three scorecards by matching 29-28 scores.\nAldo nearly finished Zahabi in the third round with a head kick, followed by a flurry of strikes. However, Zahabi was able to survive Aldo’s attacks, gain the top position, and open a cut on Aldo.\nThe win for Zahabi (13-2, MMA) marked Brazilian Aldo’s (32-10) final MMA fight, announcing his retirement in the Octagon.\n“I just don’t have it in my heart any more,” said Aldo, 38. “I think this is the last time you’re going to see me.”\nWomen’s flyweight Natalia Silva of Brazil knocked off former champion Alexa Grasso from her top-contender status with a unanimous decision win, all by 30-27 scores.\nSilva (19-5-1, MMA) has won her first six UFC fights, while Mexico’s Grasso (16-5-1, MMA) has to return to the drawing board to remain in contention. Silva opened a noticeable cut above Grasso’s eyelid, swinging the momentum in the second round before a one-sided Round 3 followed suit with dominant kickboxing ability.\nLightweight Benoit Saint-Denis of France had no trouble beating Canadian Kyle Prepolec, a late replacement, with an arm triangle choke at 2:35 of the second round.\nIt was Saint-Denis’s (14-3) first win since November 2023, snapping a two-fight losing skid. Prepolec (18-9) stepped in for Joel Alvarez (22-3) and made his first Octagon appearance since 2019.",

    "text": "At least seven people have died, and main roads were cut off after heavy rains led to flooding in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu.\nThe regional administration spokesperson, Abdinasir Hirsi Idle, said on Saturday that rescue efforts were continuing.\n“The death toll could rise because the rains were heavy and lasted for several hours, causing nine houses to collapse across different neighbourhoods, and at least six major roads to suffer severe damage,” he said.\nSomalia has in the past suffered extreme climate shocks, including prolonged dry seasons that have caused droughts and heavy rains resulting in floods.\nFriday’s rains went on for about eight hours, leaving waist-high waters in neighbourhoods where some residents were trapped and others were forced to move to higher ground.\nA resident, Mohamed Hassan, told The Associated Press news agency that some older people were still trapped.\n“We spent the night on rooftops, shivering from the cold, and I haven’t even had breakfast,” he said.\nFloodwaters also damaged key infrastructure, halting public transport and temporarily disrupting operations at the main Aden Abdulle airport. Officials later confirmed flights had resumed.\nThe Somalia Disaster Management Agency has not yet released an official death toll, but it said the assessment was under way to determine the extent of the damage.\nThe country’s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources said in a statement on Saturday that “a substantial amount of rainfall, exceeding 115mm, was recorded in over 8 consecutive hours” and warned of flash floods in other regions outside the capital.",

    "title": "Amid fragile ceasefire, Trump promises to boost trade with India and Pakistan",
    "text": "A fragile ceasefire was holding between India and Pakistan on Sunday, after hours of overnight fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as US president Donald Trump said he would work to provide a solution regarding Kashmir.\nThe arch-rivals were involved in intense firing for four days, the worst in nearly three decades, with missiles and drones being fired at each other’s military installations and dozens of people killed.\nA ceasefire agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the US, but within hours artillery fire was witnessed in Indian Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting.\nBlasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under blackout, similar to the previous two evenings, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses.\nLate on Saturday, India said Pakistan had violated the understanding to stop firing and that Indian armed forces had been instructed to “deal strongly” with any repetition.\nIn response, Pakistan said it was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations.\nBy dawn, the fighting and explosions reported overnight had died down on both sides of the border, according to Reuters witnesses.\nPower was restored in most areas along India’s border towns after a blackout the previous night.\nTrump praised leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression.\n“While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “Additionally, I will work with you both to see if ... a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”\nIn the border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, a siren sounded in the morning to resume normal activities brought a sense of relief and people were seen out on the roads.\nThe fighting started on Wednesday, two weeks after 26 men were killed in an attack targeting Hindus in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n“Ever since the day terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty,” said Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in Amritsar. “I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides.”\nOfficials in Pakistan said there was some firing in Bhimber in Pakistani-administered Kashmir overnight but nowhere else, and there were no casualties.\nThe two countries, born out of British colonial rule in 1947, have gone to war three times - twice over the region of Kashmir.\nHindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full.\nIndia blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India.\nPakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.\nThe combined death toll in the recent skirmishes has reached nearly 70, officials have said.",

    "title": "At least 33 people killed in suspected RSF attacks in Sudan",
    "text": "At least 33 people have been killed in Sudan in attacks suspected to have been carried out by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) as the brutal two-year war claims its latest victims.\nAn RSF strike on a prison on Saturday in el-Obeid killed at least 19 people, while on Friday evening, at least 14 members of the same family were killed in an air attack in Darfur, local sources said.\nThe attacks – part of the RSF’s ongoing war with the military-led government’s Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) since 2023 – came after six straight days of the paramilitary group’s drone attacks on the army-led government’s wartime capital of Port Sudan.\nThese attacks damaged key infrastructure, including a power grid and the country’s last operational civilian airport, which was a key gateway for aid into the war-ravaged nation.\nThe war has left tens of thousands dead, displaced 13 million people and triggered what the United Nations calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.\nThe attack on the prison on Saturday also wounded 45 people, a medical source told the AFP news agency. The source said the jail in the army-controlled city in the North Kordofan state capital was hit by an RSF drone.\nThe night before, 14 people were killed at the Abu Shouk displacement camp near el-Fasher in Darfur, a rescue group said, blaming the paramilitary.\nThe camp “was the target of intense bombardment by the Rapid Support Forces on Friday evening”, said the group of volunteer aid workers.\nThe camp near el-Fasher, the last state capital in Darfur still out of the RSF’s control, is plagued by famine, according to the UN.\nIt is home to tens of thousands of people who fled the violence of successive conflicts in Darfur and the conflict that has been ripping Africa’s third-largest country asunder since 2023.\nThe RSF has shelled the camp several times in recent weeks.\nAbu Shouk is located near the Zamzam camp, which the RSF seized in April after a devastating offensive that virtually emptied it.\nRSF escalation\nElsewhere on Saturday, SAF warplanes struck RSF positions in the Darfur cities of Nyala and el-Geneina, destroying arms depots and military equipment, a military source told AFP.\nThe RSF has recently said it had taken the strategic town of al-Nahud in West Kordofan, a key army supply line to Darfur.\nThe RSF’s escalation in Port Sudan earlier this month came after the military struck the Nyala airport in South Darfur, where the RSF receives foreign military assistance, including drones. Local media stated that dozens of RSF officers were killed in the attack.\nSudan’s army-aligned authorities accuse the United Arab Emirates of supplying those drones to the RSF, which has no air force of its own.\nThe war began as a power struggle between SAF chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. It has effectively divided the country into two, with the army controlling the north, east and centre, while the RSF and its allies dominate nearly all of Darfur in the west and parts of the south.\nBoth sides have been accused of committing war crimes.",

    "title": "There is suffering everywhere you look, says mother of emaciated baby girl trapped in Gaza",
    "text": "Siwar Ashour was born into war and hunger and has known nothing else. She is now in real danger of dying without ever having known a moment of peace or contentment.\nThe six-month-old Palestinian girl, whose painfully emaciated body symbolised the deliberate starvation of Gaza when she appeared on the BBC this week, was only 2.5kg when she was born on 20 November last year.\nFrom birth, Siwar had a problem with her oesophagus that has made it hard for her to drink breast milk and left her dependent on specialised formula, which is in critically short supply.\nHer parents’ home in al-Nuseirat, halfway up the coast on the Gaza Strip, was bombed earlier in the war, which began in October 2023 when Hamas killed 1,200 people in Israel, leading to an Israeli assault that has so far killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza. They lived in tents for a while but it was almost impossible to get food or water in the camp and it also came under Israeli fire.\nThey tried going back to al-Nuseirat to stay at Siwar’s grandparents’ home, but that was bombed, too. All that was left of the building was a single room, which they shared with 11 other people. That was where Siwar was born.\n“I was exhausted all the time. There was no privacy, and I couldn’t get any rest,” Najwa Aram, Siwar’s 23-year-old mother said. “There was no food or proper nutrition, and when I gave birth to her, she was not like other babies.”\n“When she was born, she was beautiful despite the weakness visible on her features,” she said. “But now she is unnaturally thin. Babies her age are supposed to weigh six kilograms6kg or more – not just 2 to 4kg.”\nNajwa found out last month she was pregnant with her second child, but lives in terror of losing Siwar before her brother or sister is born. She has moved to Khan Younis to stay with her mother, but has spent most of the past few months in hospital with her frail daughter.\nHer husband, Saleh, is blind, and had to stay behind in al-Nuseirat. The relentless bombing has forced the family to move several times, like almost all families in Gaza, and has torn them apart.\n“Even though Siwar’s father is blind, he used to play with her a lot. He visited us in the hospital only once, as he cannot move without someone accompanying him,” Najwa said. “He fears for her even more than I do – he is deeply attached to her.”\nThe family has no source of income so relies on charity kitchens for food and some humanitarian aid, but that too is in desperately short supply as Israel’s total blockade of Gaza approaches the 70-day mark. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief agency, Unrwa, said this week: “the manmade and politically motivated starvation in Gaza is an expression of absolute cruelty”.\nNajwa and her mother have a single sack of flour left, as well as a few tins.\n“Once this runs out, we won’t be able to buy anything due to the high prices,” Najwa said. Even more critically, supplies of the special milk formula that Siwar needs are harder and harder to find.\n“I am also suffering from malnutrition. Still, I try to breastfeed Siwar, but she refuses and continues to cry, completely rejecting me,” Najwa said. “That’s why I’ve had to rely more on formula milk. When I used to breastfeed her, one can of formula would last a month. Now it runs out in less than a week.”\nNajwa and her daughter spent much of March in hospital in Deir al-Balah, where there was a milk formula that seemed to work, bringing Siwar’s weight up to 4kg.\n“I noticed that Siwar started to smile and play, which made me happy and gave me hope that her health might improve.”\nBut that fragile moment of hope crumbled when they were discharged, and Siwar started losing weight again. She was referred to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, where mother and daughter remain, for now.\n“The doctors are doing everything they can to take care of her, but she also doesn’t tolerate the formula they prepare for her,” Najwa said. “The hospital situation is bad. There are six patients in each room. Everywhere you look, there is suffering. There’s a child in worse condition than Siwar.”\n“Seeing my daughter in this state every day gives me insomnia,” she said. “I’m constantly anxious and overthinking. Sometimes I can’t bear seeing her like this, and I start crying. I’m so afraid of losing her. Can’t the world open the crossings to allow in milk, food, and medicine. All I want is for my daughter Siwar to live like the rest of the children in the world.”\nDr Ahmed al-Farah, the director of the children’s and maternity building at the Nasser medical complex, said between five and 10 new malnutrition cases are being recorded there every day.\n“We’re seeing severe cases. Malnutrition appears in children in a horrifying and extremely visible way,” Farah said. “We have nothing to offer them. They need proteins, but there are none. We try to provide a little milk, perhaps powdered milk, but we can’t offer anything more.\n“On top of that, the severe overcrowding in hospitals leads to increased disease transmission among children,” he added.\nThere is only enough fuel left at the Nasser complex to keep the generators going for another 48 hours. They have already had to shut off electricity on the administrative floors to make it last a little bit longer, but the power supply will soon have to be cut to the overcrowded patients’ wards.\n“We are helpless in the face of their needs – we cannot provide food, supplements, medication, or vitamins appropriate for their conditions,” the doctor said. “I studied malnutrition in medical school textbooks. I used to think that study would remain theoretical, something we’d never see in real life. But now, those textbook descriptions have come to life before our eyes in Gaza,” Farah said.\n“I call on the world to see us as human beings – we were created just like everyone else.”",

    "title": "Immigrants set for Libya deportation sat on tarmac for hours, attorney says",
    "text": "Immigrants in Texas who were told they would be deported to Libya sat on a military airfield tarmac for hours on Wednesday, unsure of what would happen next, an attorney for one of the men has said.\nThe attorney, Tin Thanh Nguyen, told the news agency Reuters that his client, a Vietnamese construction worker from Los Angeles, was among the immigrants woken in the early morning hours and bussed from an immigration detention center in Pearsall, Texas, to an airfield where a military aircraft awaited them.\nAfter several hours, they were bussed back to the detention center around noon, the attorney said on Thursday.\nThe Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon and the state department did not respond to requests for comment.\nReuters was first to report that the Trump administration was poised to deport immigrants held in the US to Libya, despite a court order against such a move, in a development that would escalate Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\nOfficials earlier this week told Reuters the US military could fly the immigrants to the north African country as soon as Wednesday, but stressed that plans could change.\nA US official said the flight never departed. As of Friday, it was unclear if the administration was still planning to proceed with the deportations.\nA federal judge in Boston ruled on Wednesday that any effort by the Trump administration to deport non-Libyan immigrants to Libya without adequate screenings for possible persecution or torture would clearly violate a prior court order.\nLawyers for a group of immigrants pursuing a class action lawsuit had made an emergency request to the court hours after the news broke of the potential flight to Libya.\nNguyen, who declined to name his client, said the man was told on Monday to sign a document agreeing to be deported to Libya. The man, who can not read English well, declined to sign it and was placed in solitary confinement and shackled along with others, the attorney said.\nThe man was never provided an opportunity to express a fear of being deported to Libya as required under federal immigration law and the recent judicial order, Nguyen said.\n“They said: ‘We’re deporting you to Libya,’ even though he hadn’t signed the form, he didn’t know what the form was,” Nguyen said.\nNguyen said his client, originally from Vietnam, has lived in the US since the 1990s but was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) earlier this year during a regular check-in, which is becoming more common.\nVietnam declines to accept some deportees and processes deportation paperwork slowly, Nguyen said, making it harder for the US to send deportees there.",

    "title": "Children eat more after seeing just five minutes of junk food ads, study finds",
    "text": "Children will eat significantly more calories in a day after watching just five minutes of junk food advertising, according to a groundbreaking study.\nYoung people who saw or heard adverts for products high in saturated fat, sugar and salt consumed an average of 130 extra calories, equivalent to two slices of bread, the research found.\nThe study involved 240 seven- to 15-year-olds, from schools in Merseyside. On two separate occasions, they were shown or played five minutes of junk food adverts and then non-food adverts.\nSubsequently, they were offered snacks such as grapes or chocolate buttons, and later, lunch with a range of savoury, sweet and healthy items.\nThe authors calculated that, after the adverts, the children consumed 58 calories more in snacks and ate 73 more calories for lunch than after exposure to non-food ads.\nThe research, to be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Málaga, Spain, also found that the impact on calorie intake was the same whether the adverts were for specific foods or were generic adverts for fast food brands.\nAnd it was unaffected by the type of advert, such as video with sound, social media posts, podcast adverts, and posters or billboards.\nEmma Boyland, the lead author of the study and professor of food marketing and child health at the University of Liverpool, said: “This is the first study to show that brand-only food advertising affects what children eat.\n“We also showed that children don’t just eat more immediately following food advertising, they actually ate more at the lunch meal as well, a couple of hours after they had seen the advertising.\n“The foods that we served them weren’t the same foods that were shown in the advertisements and were presented with no branding information. So it wasn’t that they were driven to buy the particular food or go and consume fast food, it was just a prompt to consume what was available.”\nExperts warned that the findings revealed a loophole in the government’s proposed ban on junk food TV adverts before 9pm, due to come into effect in October.\nKatharine Jenner, the director of the Obesity Health Alliance, said the study must send “a clear message to policymakers: food advertising is driving excess calorie intake in children”.\nShe added: “From October, new restrictions will limit unhealthy food adverts on TV before 9pm and online at any time – a vital step forward that will protect children from the worst offenders.\n“But loopholes remain. Brands will still be able to advertise to young people even without showing specific products, on billboards and at bus stops, and children living with overweight or obesity are especially vulnerable.\n“If the government is serious about ending junk food advertising to children, they must close the loopholes that will allow companies to keep bombarding them.”\nDr Helen Stewart, the officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “Childhood obesity is stubbornly high, with children in the most deprived areas facing rates more than twice as high as their peers. Paediatricians recognise that tackling this crisis is impossible without also introducing necessary measures such as regulations on the food industry.”\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government has taken bold action to end junk food ads targeted at children on TV and online, which will reduce the number living with obesity by 20,000 and deliver health benefits to the economy worth £2bn.\n“We are encouraging the industry to focus on healthier options by allowing companies to advertise healthier alternatives in identified categories.”",

    "title": "Ukraine: What Trump does next is key",
    "text": "Volodymyr Zelensky has given a cautious and diplomatic response to Vladimir Putin's late-night offer of direct talks in Istanbul next Thursday.\nThe Ukrainian leader might have been expected to slam his opposite number in Moscow for not committing to a 30-day ceasefire, as demanded by Kyiv and its Western allies on Saturday.\nInstead, writing on X, Zelensky called it \"a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war\".\nZelensky added that Ukraine expected Russia to confirm it would abide by the proposed 30-day ceasefire, starting on Monday.\nIt's hard to tell if Zelensky really sees Putin's offer of direct talks as a \"positive sign\". This is as much about optics as anything else.\nNeither Putin nor Zelensky want to be seen by US President Donald Trump as the obstacle to peace.\nFollow live updates\nTrump's reaction was markedly upbeat. Writing on his Truth Social platform earlier, he hinted once again that this war was close to ending. He wrote: \"A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!\"\nPutin said he wants to address what he calls \"the root causes of the conflict\".\nFrom his perspective, that means Ukraine's unacceptable ambition to be part of a prosperous, democratic Europe rather than returning to Moscow's orbit and become a pliant, satellite nation like Belarus.\nHe will also want a firm undertaking that Ukraine will never join Nato.\nMoscow demanded on Saturday that, before any ceasefire can start, the West must stop arming Ukraine.\nThat of course would leave this country that much less able to fend off Russia's gradual advances on the frontline - or, worse, a new full-scale offensive to take more land.\nWhat Ukraine badly needs from its allies is an uninterrupted flow of air defences to fend off the ever-growing numbers of drones and missiles being fired across the common border at Kyiv and other major cities.\nShortly after dawn on Sunday, we were woken by an air raid alert and sirens went off as more Russian drones were launched.\nOn 9 May, the US Embassy in Kyiv issued a warning to its citizens that there was \"a significant risk of air raids in the coming days\".\nOne of the biggest concerns is that the Kremlin may launch another Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile like the one its forces fired at a factory in Dnipro last November.\nWith its velocity approaching 10 times the speed of sound, Russia boasts that this missile is \"unstoppable\".\nSo now the key question is what Trump does next - and this could go either way.\nHe could decide that his opposite number in Moscow is simply stringing him along, finding one excuse after another not to agree to a ceasefire.\nOr, given his historic warm relations with Putin, will he throw the Russian leader a diplomatic lifeline and put pressure on Ukraine instead to sit down in Istanbul and listen to Moscow's demands, irrespective of whether there is a ceasefire come Monday?",

    "title": "Care worker recruitment from abroad to end, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper says",
    "text": "Care workers will no longer be recruited from overseas as part of a crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, the home secretary has told the BBC.\nYvette Cooper said \"it is time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad\" and rules will change this year - instead requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country.\nThe government plans to unveil a series of changes to visa and recruitment laws on Monday in a bid to cut net migration, and says measures will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year.\nShadow home secretary Chris Philp said the plans were \"too little\" and called for an annual cap on migration.\nSuccessive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving.\nNet migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000.\nThe Home Office has not yet officially confirmed what will be in its immigration White Paper, due early next week.\nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cooper said the government \"was setting up plans for a substantial reduction in net migration\" but added targets would not be set, saying \"they undermined the credibility of anything that governments do\".\nThe threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure.\nThere will also be a \"narrower\" list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries, Cooper said, but did not give examples.\nAs well as visa changes, the home secretary added there would be new requirements for training commitments \"to get people who are not working back into the labour market here in the UK\".\nPhilp - who said he agreed with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad - told the same programme the Conservatives would push Parliament to vote on a yearly migration cap this week.\nWhen asked what the cap would be, he said \"we're working on the detail to specify that number\", but it would be \"a further reduction of significantly more than 50,000\".\nHe argued that if Labour had stuck with Tory changes net migration would have dropped \"by about 400,000\".\nCooper also said there would be \"some changes\" to rules around international students and graduates.\n\"We will let them continue to come and to stay and to work afterwards,\" she added.\n\"We are making some changes, particularly around the standards and the compliance for universities, because, again, we've had problems where some universities haven't had proper standards in place.\n\"They've recruited people to come as international students who then haven't completed their courses, have either overstayed or... other problems with compliance of the system.\"\nThe government has already tightened rules around care sector worker after coming to power last July.\nApplications for Health and Care Worker visas peaked at 18,300 in August 2023, then collapsed to 1,700 by April this year following the ban on bringing dependants.\nAnd on 9 April, an additional restriction was added requiring care firms who want to recruit a new worker from overseas to prove they attempted to recruit a worker from within England first.\nBut the new rules will now require care companies to recruit from domestic workers or a pool of over 10,000 care workers in the UK with cancelled sponsorships before hiring from abroad.\nAlongside this Cooper promised \"to bring in a new fair pay agreement for care workers\" to make care jobs more attractive to UK workers and reduce overseas demand.",

    "title": "Trump complains the US media aren’t bending to his will. Aren’t they?",
    "text": "In the telling of Donald Trump and his Republican colleagues, the US media is fake news, stocked with “radical-left monsters” who are guilty of “illegal” reporting on the president.\nThe reality is different.\nSince Trump’s election, a number of US news organizations have appeared to bend to Trump’s will, with a growing number of examples of billionaire owners seemingly setting aside journalistic independence in favor of staying in Trump’s good grace.\nDespite that acquiescence, Trump has continued to threaten journalists, branding pollsters “negative criminals” who “should be investigated for election fraud”. In April, he attacked “radical lunatic Democrats and their comrades in the fake news media”, adding: “Those lying to the American People on behalf of violent criminals have to be held responsible by the Agencies and the Courts.”\nThe attacks overlook the ways in which some outlets have submitted to Trump’s will – either by executives settling frivolous lawsuits or wealthy owners interfering to avoid upsetting Trump.\nJeff Bezos, the Washington Post owner, ordered an overhaul to the paper’s editorial pages in February that effectively muzzled the newspaper’s criticism of Trump. The Los Angeles Times dropped its endorsement of Kamala Harris under pressure from Patrick Soon-Shiong, its billionaire owner.\nIn December, ABC News settled a Trump lawsuit, in a move first amendment experts said could foster more attacks on the media. And in another blow, the owner of CBS News is said to be considering settling a $10bn lawsuit brought against the network over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview.\nThe New York Times reported that lawyers for Paramount were planning to mediate with Trump over the issue, despite legal experts dismissing the lawsuit as frivolous. CBS said its show 60 Minutes edited one of Harris’s answers for time, a normal journalistic practice. Paramount is in talks to be sold to Skydance, a sale that needs approval from the Trump administration. Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, would land a huge windfall if the deal went ahead, and has told Paramount’s board of directors she is in favor of settling with Trump, according to the Times.\n“The people bowing to Trump are the owners of all of these media outlets, or top management,” said Heather Hendershot, a professor of communication studies and journalism at Northwestern University.\n“It’s hugely problematic, and it’s absolutely driven by their bottom lines. Jeff Bezos doesn’t need to make money off of the Washington Post. He could break even, or lose money on the Washington Post, and he would be just fine, but it could make trouble for him and his other business enterprises, so he’d rather toe [Trump’s] line.”\nIt wasn’t always this way. Hendershot drew a comparison with how CBS handled a complaint in the 1970s, over its The Selling of the Pentagon documentary. Back then, CBS was ordered to hand over all film and sound recordings from the film, but the president of CBS, Frank Stanton, refused the subpoena from the House commerce committee, risking going to jail.\nThe current-day CBS leadership appears to be less stout. In January, CBS decided to comply with the FCC’s request to release the “full, unedited transcript and camera feeds” of the Harris interview.\nSemafor reported that the potential for Redstone to meddle in 60 Minutes’ reporting is what led Bill Owens, the show’s executive producer, to leave the flagship news program earlier this year.\n“Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience,” Owens said at the time.\nLast week, eight Democratic senators, including Bernie Sanders, wrote a letter to Redstone and Paramount Global’s board describing the lawsuit as “an attack on the United States Constitution and the First Amendment” and urging them not to settle with Trump.\n“It has absolutely no merit and it cannot stand,” the senators said. They said Trump’s lawsuit is “a blatant attempt to intimidate the media and those who speak out against him”.\nCBS News does not appear to have allowed the lawsuit to affect its coverage. Earlier this month, 60 Minutes ran a long report on Trump’s presidential orders targeting law firms.\n“In recent weeks, President Trump has signed orders against several law firms – orders with the power to destroy them,” 60 Minutes host Scott Pelley said at the start of the show. “That matters because lawsuits have been a check on the president’s power.”\nMatt Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a watchdog group, said CBS News “continued to do hard-hitting reporting on the Trump administration”.\n“Will they still be able to do that six months, a year, down the road? We don’t know,” Gertz said.\n“The fact that we need to have these conversations, the fact that we have the president openly pushing for investigations into particular media outlets – and that we have those institutions, apparently in response, trying to find ways to assuage him – all of that is not something we should be comfortable with in a liberal democracy.”\nGertz said some owners made a miscalculation in bowing to Trump, overestimating his support among voters and thus his ability to target whichever institutions he chooses. But recent polling has shown that Trump is deeply unpopular, with even his support among Republicans falling.\n“The landscape is moving quickly under the feet of some of these corporate media owners, and they should recognize that and grow spines and try to protect the crown jewels of the US free press that they are overseeing,” Gertz said.\nThere is also the sense that settling with Trump over a particular issue could be a fool’s errand. Trump’s insistence on fawning, unquestioning coverage means even he is likely to continue to be upset by mainstream media coverage – even if an organization has cowed to him on a previous story.\nWhile Trump-soothing movements may continue in the background, journalists have largely resisted the direction their outlets’ owners have taken. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times have continued to interrogate the excesses of Trump’s presidency, as have reporters elsewhere, although the threat of interference in the editorial process is higher than ever.\nGertz said “we will never really be able to know” whether editors are forced to bow to owners’ pressure.\n“So much of what happens in the media happens in small, private discussions, where editors and reporters try to decide on what to cover and how to cover it. These stories that are left unpublished, we generally just won’t be able to tell if they should have run, if there was enough support for them,” he said.\n“I think that to some extent, we won’t know whether we’ve lost the free press until it’s gone.”",

    "text": "Simon Mann, an Eton and Sandhurst-educated ex-SAS officer, who led a botched coup involving Margaret Thatcher’s son to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea, has died aged 72.\nMann led a group of 70 fellow mercenaries who were arrested in Zimbabwe in 2004 for attempting to topple Equatorial Guinea’s despotic president, Teodoro Obiang.\nMann and his friend Mark Thatcher admitted involvement in the attempted plot, which became known as the “wonga coup”. When the plot was revealed, Obiang threatened to eat Mann’s testicles and drag his naked body through the streets.\nMann served more than five years in two of the world’s most notorious jails before being pardoned by Obiang himself.\nHe had previously served in the Scots Guards and the SAS before setting up a number of security firms specialised in protecting oil installations.\nIn March 2004 Mann, Nick du Toit and three other South African mercenaries plotted Obiang’s overthrow with international financial backers and the tacit approval of at least three governments, most notably Spain.\nThe coup involved flying into the former Spanish colony in a plane loaded with arms and more than 50 black “Buffalo soldiers” – former members of the now disbanded South African defence forces’ elite 32 battalion– to replace Obiang with an exiled opposition activist called Severo Moto.\nIn return, the plotters and their backers were hoping to tap into Equatorial Guinea’s reserves of oil and natural gas. But their plane was intercepted by the Zimbabweans at Harare airport. A jubilant President Robert Mugabe threw Mann and his fellow conspirators into jail before handing them over to Equatorial Guinea where a court sentenced the mercenary to 34 years in jail.\nIn a note sent out to his legal team while he was being held, Mann implicated Thatcher, whom he referred to by the name Scratcher, in the coup. The note also pleaded for a “large splodge of wonga” and that Thatcher use his influence to secure his release.\nIn his trial, Mann admitted he had been approach by Ely Calil, a Lebanese oil tycoon who was a friend of Moto, who regarded himself as head of Equatorial Guinea’s government in exile.\nThatcher was alleged to have paid for a helicopter to fly Moto from Equatorial Guinea during the planned coup. He was fined and given a four-year suspended sentence for his part in the coup after admitting breaking anti-mercenary legislation. But he claimed he was only unwittingly involved in the plot.\nIn 2006 the plot was dramatised in Coup!, a TV movie written by the comic John Fortune.\nAfter his pardon, Mann returned to the UK. He was married three times and had nine children. MailOnline reported that he had died earlier this week while exercising in a gym.",

    "title": "European leaders tell Putin to agree to unconditional ceasefire by Monday or face ‘massive’ sanctions - as it happened",
    "text": "Key events\nShow key events only\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\nClosing summary\nIt is approaching 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow. This blog will be closing shortly, but you can find all the Guardian’s Russia-Ukraine coverage here and Shaun Walker’s latest report from Kyiv below:\nHere is a summary of the day’s developments:\nEuropean leaders on a joint visit to Kyiv have issued an ultimatum to Vladimir Putin: sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday, or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers to Ukraine. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany and Poland, together with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a joint phone call to Donald Trump prior to making the announcement. It was the first time the leaders of the four European nations hadmade a joint visit to Ukraine. “We are clear the bloodshed must end. Russia must stop its illegal invasion,” the leaders said in a joint statement.\nZelenskyy told reporters at the news conference after their talks that the ceasefire should cover air, sea and land, and said that if Moscow refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Friday that Russia supported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of “nuances”.\nThe Kremlin accused European countries on Saturday of making contradictory and confrontational statements, Interfax news agency reported, after European leaders backed a US plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine and threatened Russia with “massive” sanctions if it failed to comply. “We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying.\nIn an earlier interview with ABC News, Peskov said Russia would require a halt to US and European arms supplies to Ukraine during any potential ceasefire. “Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine. Ukraine will continue their total mobilisation, bringing new troops to [the] frontline,” Peskov said.\nKeir Starmer has said there is “absolute unity” of countries around the world on Ukraine. Speaking from Kyiv on Saturday, the prime minister was asked if he believed Vladimir Putin wanted peace and why he thought the threat of sanctions would work. Starmer replied: “There’s only one country that stands between peace, and that’s Russia.” Starmer said “all of us here, together with US, are calling Putin out”, adding that if the Russian president was “serious” about peace then “he has a chance to show it now by extending the VE Day pause into a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire”.\nStarmer also said UK experts and European partners were working to “boost Ukraine’s economy” in an attempt to support the invaded country’s stability long-term. Speaking at the ‘coalition of the willing’ meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, the UK prime minister said “securing Ukraine’s future for the longer term” had been discussed, with measures including the resumption of flights to Ukraine.\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron called on Saturday for “direct talks” between Ukraine and Russia in the event of a ceasefire in Moscow’s three-year invasion. If there is a 30-day truce, as western countries have floated, “we will look to direct talks between Ukraine and Russia, we are ready to help,” Macron said in an interview with French news outlets TF1 and LCI while travelling to Kyiv to meet European leaders.\nGerman chancellor Friedrich Merz warned Russia would face harder sanctions if it refused a 30-day ceasefire demanded by the west, in an interview published on Saturday by the Bild daily. If Putin does not agree to the truce, “there will be a massive hardening of sanctions and the massive aid to Ukraine will continue – politically, of course, but also financially and militarily,” said Merz.\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday backed a proposed unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine and said that the EU is ready to impose further “biting” sanctions on Russia in the event of a breach of a ceasefire. “The ball is now in Russia’s court. We stand ready to maintain strong pressure on Russia,” said von der Leyen.\nNato secretary general Mark Rutte said on Saturday after joining a ‘coalition of the willing’ call with Kyiv’s partners that it was clear the group is committed and continues to stand with Ukraine.\nRussia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had made four more attempts in the past 24 hours to break across the border into Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, although Reuters could not independently verify the assertion. Ukraine says Russia has continued to attack it and has called the ceasefire a “farce”.\nOn Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day had killed three residents and injured four more. Another civilian man died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin. An Associated Press tally, based on reports from Ukrainian authorities, found at least 117 civilians had been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Russian aerial attacks since Ukraine announced on 11 March its willingness for a ceasefire.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un said North Korea’s involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war was justified, calling it an exercise of sovereign rights in defence of a “brother nation,” state media KCNA reported on Saturday. He also said Pyongyang would not hesitate to authorise the use of military force if the United States persisted in military provocations against Russia.\nShare\nUpdated at 15.46 BST\nAway from Ukraine for a moment, Valdimir Putin has attended a working lunch with the leader of Vietman’s Communist party, Tô Lâm, in Moscow today:\nShare\nKeir Starmer has said that he and European allies “together with the US” are “calling Putin out”, reports the PA news agency.\nSpeaking from Kyiv, he said the five leaders in the Ukrainian capital on Saturday had agreed on the need for an “unconditional ceasefire”.\nThe prime minister said “all of us here, together with US, are calling Putin out”.\nHe said that if the Russian president is “serious” about peace then “he has a chance to show it now by extending the VE Day pause into a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire”.\nStarmer added:\nNo more ifs and buts, no more conditions and delays.\nHe also said:\nUkraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again, but again and again, Putin has refused.\nSo we are clear, all five leaders here – all the leaders of the meeting we just had with the coalition of the willing – an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond.\nWorking with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressure Russia back to the table.\nShare\nKeir Starmer has said UK experts and European partners are working to “boost Ukraine’s economy” in an attempt to support the invaded country’s stability long-term, reports the PA news agency.\nSpeaking at the ‘coalition of the willing’ meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, the UK prime minister said “securing Ukraine’s future for the longer term” had been discussed, with measures including the resumption of flights to Ukraine.\nStarmer said:\nWe want to help Ukraine look to the future with confidence.\nSo we’re working to boost Ukraine’s economy and, as a vital step, I’m pleased that UK experts have been on the ground leading work to support the resumption of flights into Ukraine.\nHe added:\nOnce a ceasefire is achieved it will take time but this will be a huge moment in reconnecting Ukraine’s economy, boosting investor confidence, and helping to reunite families separated by this war.\nUkraine secure and thriving: that is what we all want to see.\nWith our 100-year partnership, the critical minerals deal with the US, and our coalition of the willing, we are building the framework for peace in Ukraine to support a better future for the Ukrainian people, and to pledge once again in all our interests and on this anniversary, that aggression will never prevail on our continent.\nShare\nUpdated at 15.45 BST\nKremlin says European countries' statements are 'confrontational' - Interfax reports\nThe Kremlin accused European countries on Saturday of making contradictory and confrontational statements, Interfax news agency reported, after European leaders backed a US plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine and threatened Russia with “massive” sanctions if it failed to comply.\n“We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying.\nShare\n'Only one country that stands between peace, and that’s Russia': says Starmer in Kyiv\nKeir Starmer has said there is “absolute unity” of countries around the world on Ukraine, reports the PA news agency.\nThe prime minister said it “must be Russia that now comes forward and accepts this 30-day unconditional ceasefire”.\nSpeaking from Kyiv on Saturday, the prime minister was asked if he believes Vladimir Putin wants peace and why he thinks the threat of sanctions would work. Starmer replied:\nThere’s only one country that stands between peace, and that’s Russia.\nHe added:\nThe position we’ve now got to today is absolute unity across a whole range of countries around the world.\nStarmer also said the leaders were “clear absolutely there must be an unconditional ceasefire for 30 days. Clear that that means it must be without conditions”.\nShare\nIn Kyiv, UK prime minister Keir Starmer addressed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying:\nVolodymyr and the Ukrainian people, we stood with you in resisting Putin’s aggression but we must now stand with you in the fight for peace.\nPutin has, in the last few hours, sought to put conditions on a ceasefire.\nIt’s really important that we make clear, an unconditional ceasefire is a ceasefire without conditions. We reject the imposition of conditions, and we need to be really clear about that.\nIt is for Russia to come to the table for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, and there must be clear sanctions if he fails to do so.\nThere is real unity on that. We need to be clear that that is one of the main outcomes we want from this meeting of the coalition of the willing, here this morning.\nVolodymyr, you have our support in the fight that you have, you have our support in the fight for peace, as we go forward.\nShare\nUK prime minister Keir Starmer said “one country started this illegal conflict” and “only one country stands in the way of resolving it peacefully” during a meeting of members of the “coalition of the willing” aimed at end the Russian invasion of Ukraine, reports the PA news agency.\nSpeaking from Kyiv, Starmer said:\nIt is an important moment because, as Volodymyr [Zelenskyy] has just said, there is this ceasefire-for-30-days proposal that is very clearly now on the table.\nVolodymyr, I think you first – with courage – put forward this proposal probably two months ago now, as the way forward? Emmanuel [Macron] and I have been discussing it intensively, including this week, and pushing the case of 30 days.\nOther allies in Europe have joined that, and of course the US position is now absolutely clear. So we have unity in relation to the proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.\nThat is a really important moment of this conflict that we should focus on in this meeting of the coalition of the willing, and remind ourselves that only one country started this illegal conflict, and that was Russia and Putin, and only one country stands in the way of resolving it peacefully, and that is Russia and Putin.\nShare\nBritish prime minister Keir Starmer said in a meeting in the Ukrainian capital with European leaders that the so-called “coalition of the willing” shows “the strength of our unity”.\nSitting alongside Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, Starmer said: “It’s really good that we are hosting this meeting – the coalition of the willing – from Kyiv.\n“It is a very important symbolic meeting showing the strength of our unity.\n“And it’s timely because this awful conflict has been going on now for over three years, and this week we have been celebrating 80 years since the end of the second world war, VE Day has been celebrated across Europe.\n“What the war was about were the values of freedom and democracy and the right of countries to make their own decisions, their sovereign right to do so.\n“Those are the same values that we are addressing here today, and so it is timely, it is important and I pay tribute to the courage and resilience of the Ukrainians that have fought this conflict for three long years.”\nShare\nEuropean leaders issue ceasefire ultimatum to Putin\nShaun Walker\nEuropean leaders on a joint visit Kyiv have issued an ultimatum to Vladimir Putin: sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday, or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers to Ukraine.\nThe leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, together with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a joint phone call to Donald Trump prior to making the announcement.\n“All of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he’s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now,” said prime minister Keir Starmer at a joint press conference of the five leaders in Kyiv.\nStarmer said the leaders were demanding “an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and [are] clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with president Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions, and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressure Russia back to the table”.\nStarmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz arrived in the Ukrainian capital on the same train on Saturday morning, while Donald Tusk travelled on a separate train. The leaders met with Zelenskyy for talks in central Kyiv.\nIt is Macron’s first visit to Kyiv since summer 2022, and the first visit for Merz as chancellor for Germany, having only taken office this week.\n“All five leaders had a fruitful call with @POTUS focused on peace efforts,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on X, adding a picture of the five men gathered around a mobile phone on speaker mode.\nSybiha added: “Ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday. If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.”\nTrump and the US administration have said a 30-day ceasefire could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement such a ceasefire but Russia has so far refused, saying it would only do so if all western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were halted.\nIn an early sign that Russia may not be receptive to the latest ultimatum, the hawkish former president, Dmitry Medvedev, wrote on X: “Macron, Merz, Starmer, and Tusk were supposed to discuss peace in Kiev (sic). Instead, they are blurting out threats against Russia … You think that’s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses.”\nShare\nUpdated at 14.45 BST\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron warned on Saturday that Russia would face “massive” coordinated European and US sanctions if it broke a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine proposed by Kyiv’s western allies.\n“In the event of a violation of this ceasefire, we have agreed that massive sanctions will be prepared and coordinated between Europeans and Americans,” Macron told a press conference in Kyiv.\nShare\nUpdated at 14.44 BST\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters at the news conference after their talks that he and the visiting leaders “agreed on Monday, 12 May there must start an unconditional ceasefire”.\nHe added that it should cover air, sea and land, and said that if Moscow refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors, Reuters reported.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Friday that Russia supported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of “nuances”.\nIn remarks to ABC that were aired on Saturday, Peskov suggested that western military assistance for Ukraine would have to stop in order for a temporary ceasefire to happen. “Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine,” he said.\nShare\nUkraine and European leaders call for unconditional 30-day ceasefire from 12 May\nUkraine and European leaders agreed on Saturday to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from 12 May with the backing of US president Donald Trump, threatening president Vladimir Putin with new “massive” sanctions if he failed to comply.\nThe announcement was made by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Ukraine after a meeting in Kyiv, during which they held a phone call with Trump.\nShare\nUpdated at 13.37 BST\nThe symbolic show of European unity came a day after Russian president Vladimir Putin struck a defiant tone at a Moscow parade marking 80 years since victory in the second world war, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).\nIn an interview with the US news channel ABC on Saturday, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said arms deliveries from Ukraine’s allies would have to stop before Russia would agree to a ceasefire.\nA truce would otherwise be an “advantage for Ukraine“ at a time when “Russian troops are advancing … in quite a confident way” on the front, Peskov said, adding that Ukraine was “not ready for immediate negotiations”.\nPutin ordered a unilateral three-day truce from Thursday through Saturday. But a Ukrainian army brigade operating in the east told AFP earlier the intensity of fighting had remained “pretty much the same”.\nEurope and Ukraine argue more pressure is needed on Russia to respond.\nAfter meeting Donald Tusk in France on Friday, Emmanuel Macron called for the speedy drafting of a US-Europe plan for the 30-day truce that would be backed by “massive economic sanctions” if one side “betrays it”.\nShare",

    "title": "If India and Pakistan’s ceasefire holds, the coming weeks will see a new battle: of narratives",
    "text": "Just over 26 years ago, thousands of Pakistani soldiers quietly made their way on to high, rocky ridges on the Indian side of the de facto border that divides the former princely state of Kashmir. The war that this rash operation triggered lasted much of the summer of 1999.\nReporting on the conflict was a bizarre experience. In high mountain valleys, at altitudes more suited to mountaineers than soldiers, howitzers hurled massive shells across icy, rocky peaks and infantry readied for bayonet assaults. A Pakistani artillery officer read memoirs of English cricket stars and the Qur’an in his bunker. As spent shrapnel and rock splinters thrown up by incoming Indian shells rattled against the walls of the canvas mess tent, his commander spoke of Pakistan’s “historic national and religious duty” to free Kashmir, partitioned 50 years before, and waited for servants to bring dessert.\nThe war of 1999 was the fourth between Pakistan and India and the third to have been triggered by Kashmir. If, over the decades, technology and regional politics have evolved dramatically, recent days have made clear that the animosity generated by the dispute over the region, said to be the most beautiful in south Asia, has not. Even if the ceasefire agreed on Saturday has silenced the guns for now, there is little doubt that they will speak again.\nFor Pakistan, Kashmir’s Muslim majority means the region’s division is not just a historic injustice but an injury to the country’s original founding purpose as a home for the subcontinent’s Muslims. Just after the news of the ceasefire broke, Ishaq Dar, Pakistan’s foreign minister, posted on X that “Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region” but carefully stressed that it had done so “without compromising on its … territorial integrity!”\nKashmir means much more to India than a stunning backdrop for Bollywood movies. Many Indians would see losing the region, with its powerful historical and cultural significance, as an amputation of a vital part of their vast and diverse nation. India’s first post-independence leaders, secular and often left-leaning, made a point of fighting for Kashmir. The last weeks have shown that the country’s current leaders, rightwing religious nationalists, will do so too.\nIf this ceasefire holds, then coming weeks will see a new battle: of narratives.\nIndia has claimed that Lashkar-e-Taiba, the extremist group that carried out the massacre three weeks ago of 25 tourists and a guide in Indian-controlled Kashmir that started the conflict, is merely a proxy for Islamabad. Pakistan has denied this. Maintaining a state of conflict in Kashmir, undermining Delhi’s control there and internationalising the conflict have been strategic goals of Pakistan’s hugely powerful military for decades. Islamic militant groups, some based in Kashmir, others recruited and based elsewhere, have been a key tool to achieve this. That no one in Pakistan’s security establishment had any prior idea of April’s attack seems implausible.\nPakistani officials seek to highlight underlying causes of violence: ongoing repression in Kashmir, the revocation by Delhi of the region’s autonomous status in 2019 and multiple other grievances.\nBack in 1999, like now, rhetoric from leaders in Delhi and Islamabad was sufficiently heated to prompt genuine international worries about an all-out war between the two nuclear-armed powers. Then, again like now, the sheer horror of what that might entail, even if the conflict remained conventional, sobered decision-makers on both sides.\nTwenty years ago, a combination of Indian military success and US pressure brought about a shaky peace that survived a round of skirmishes a decade later until being broken again.\nIn this new confrontation too, Washington’s influence appears to have been key in bringing about de-escalation. This will not please Russia and China, both manoeuvring for greater influence in the region, even if the reported involvement of Turkey and Saudi Arabia is a useful reminder that the unipolar days of the late 1990s are long gone.\nCasualties this time around have been mercifully low, and economic damage limited. The latter rather than the former may have weighed most heavily in the decision to call a halt to hostilities. Neither nation can afford the kind of destruction and disruption that moving to the next level of war might have entailed. There are ties that bind, as well as much that divides. Observers noted that though Delhi effectively suspended a crucial treaty governing water access, it was not definitively broken.\nAs in previous conflicts, that of 1999 included, leaders in both India and Pakistan have stepped back from the brink, showing what Trump described in his inimitable way on Saturday as “Common Sense and Great Intelligence”. All know how much they have to lose.",

    "text": "2 hours ago\nAnna Lamche\nBBC News\nReporting from London\nSarah Rainsford\nCorrespondent\nReporting from Rome\nPope Leo XIV appealed for \"no more war\" in a message to world powers during his first Sunday address at the Vatican.\nReflecting on current conflicts, the newly selected pontiff called for a \"lasting peace\" in the war in Ukraine, a ceasefire in Gaza, and welcomed Saturday's agreement to end recent hostilities between India and Pakistan.\nHe said he was \"deeply hurt\" by events in Gaza, expressed hope for a \"lasting accord\" between India and Pakistan, and wished for a \"authentic, true and lasting peace\" in Ukraine.\nThe Pope also recited the Regina Caeli prayer, in honour of the Virgin Mary, to the crowd in St Peter's Square.\nPope Leo was chosen as the new leader of the Catholic Church on Thursday, following a two-day conclave in Vatican City and the death of his predecessor, Pope Francis.\nOn Saturday, he visited a shrine outside Rome and then prayed before Francis' tomb inside the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.\nPope Leo will be formally inaugurated at a mass in St Peter's Square next week on 18 May.\nSpeaking from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica, he said: \"The immense tragedy of the Second World War ended 80 years ago… now we're facing the tragedy of a third world war in pieces.\n\"I would also like to address the powerful people of the world, repeating the always-current call: 'no more war'.\"\nGetty Images\nReuters\nThe pontiff continued: \"I carry in my heart the suffering of the beloved Ukrainian people.\n\"May whatever is possible be done to reach an authentic, true and lasting peace as quickly as possible. May all the prisoners be freed. May children return to their families.\n\"And I am deeply hurt by what is happening in the Gaza Strip.\n\"May a ceasefire immediately come into effect. May humanitarian aid be allowed into the civilian population and may all hostages be freed.\nHe went on: \"I was happy to hear on the other hand that there was a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, and I hope that through the coming negotiations we might soon come to a lasting accord.\"\nHis remarks comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin set out competing plans for a peace process to bring the three-year invasion of Ukraine to an end.\nIn the Middle East, Israel has cut off all humanitarian aid entering Gaza and resumed its military offensive in the Palestinian territory following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement.\nMeanwhile, India and Pakistan agreed to a tentative ceasefire on Saturday after days of cross-border military strikes that followed an attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir on 22 April.\nIt has been a busy week for the pontiff, who held his first Mass as Pope in the Sistine chapel on Friday before speaking to cardinals on Saturday.\nDuring this meeting, he described himself as an unworthy choice for Pope, and vowed to continue the \"precious legacy\" of his predecessor.\nHe highlighted the importance of missionary work and discussion – as well as care for those he called the \"least and the rejected\".\nHe explained he had chosen the name Leo after a 19th-century Pope known for his teaching on social justice.\nThe new Pope also suggested the development of artificial intelligence and other advances meant the church was necessary today for the defence of human dignity and justice.",

    "title": "Iran says nuclear enrichment ‘non-negotiable’ before US talks in Oman",
    "text": "Tehran, Iran – Iran has emphasised its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes as an Iranian delegation led by the foreign minister reached the Omani capital, Muscat, for a fourth round of indirect nuclear talks with the United States.\nForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media on Sunday that the Iranian nation has a legal right to civilian enrichment that cannot be subjected to any deal.\nThe landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, from which US President Donald Trump withdrew during his first term, allowed Iran to pursue its civilian nuclear activity but put restrictions on enrichment to prevent Tehran from making a nuclear bomb.\n“Enrichment is one of the achievements and honours of the Iranian nation. We have paid a heavy price for enrichment. The blood of our nuclear scientists has been spilled for this achievement,” he said in reference to scientists assassinated by Israel over the years.\nBut Araghchi said Tehran remains committed to providing verifiable assurances that it will not be able to develop a nuclear bomb – which has been Trump’s main demand.\nAraghchi visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar and met with senior officials to coordinate in the run-up to the latest nuclear talks.\nIn the Omani capital on Sunday, Iran’s top diplomat was accompanied by his deputies and other members of the team tasked with technical talks that Iran still emphasises are held “indirectly” through Omani mediation.\nTehran has also repeatedly expressed concern over “contradictory” remarks made to the media by US negotiators, who are led by Trump’s longtime friend and envoy Steve Witkoff.\nIn the lead-up to the Muscat talks on Sunday, Witkoff again called for the complete “dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme, including key sites in Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top officials have suggested Iran must import enriched uranium.\nThe fourth round of the talks was scheduled for early May but had to be postponed with Oman citing “logistical reasons”.\nThe delay came after the US did not confirm its participation and amid a string of major fires in several Iranian cities, including one caused by an explosion in the port city of Bandar Abbas that killed dozens of people and injured more than 1,200.\nTrump sacked National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, an Iran hawk, this month after Waltz reportedly coordinated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and advocated for war with Iran.\nTrump, his team and Israel have repeatedly threatened to launch devastating military strikes on Iran and its infrastructure if the talks fail to produce results soon.\nMeanwhile, the US has continued to pile sanctions on Iran with the Treasury Department blacklisting a Chinese chemical group and three port terminal operators on Thursday in an attempt to target Iranian oil exports.\nAmid its “maximum pressure” push against Iran, the US has also promised to drive Iranian oil exports to “zero” as Tehran has continued to ship its oil – mainly to China – despite the sanctions.\nTrump started the sanctions campaign in 2018 after unilaterally reneging on the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that put verifiable and stringent limits on Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for lifting sanctions on the country.\nThe accord restricted Iran’s enrichment of uranium to 3.67 percent using first-generation centrifuges at limited sites, but it had time limits and sunset clauses that Trump claimed made it the “worst deal ever”.\nIran is currently enriching up to 60 percent, which is close to the more than 90 percent required to make a nuclear bomb, but the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tehran has made no effort to produce a weapon.",

    "title": "Trump offers to work with India, Pakistan on Kashmir ‘solution’",
    "text": "United States President Donald Trump has offered to work with India and Pakistan to achieve a “solution” for the long-disputed Kashmir region, days after his administration brokered a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed rivals.\n“I will work with you, both to see if, after a ‘thousand years,’ a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\nThe US president doubled down on a historically inaccurate assertion that India and Pakistan have been fighting for “a thousand years” or more.\nThe Muslim-majority territory has been contested since the partition of British India in 1947 into India and Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars over the region. They both stake a claim over Kashmir as a whole but control parts of it.\nIndia-administered Kashmir has seen decades of armed rebellion either for independence or a merger with Pakistan. New Delhi has deployed more than 700,000 soldiers to quash the rebellion.\nThe government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far remained committed to a decades-old policy of refusing international mediation to find a solution to the Kashmir issue. In 2019, Modi’s government stripped India-administered Kashmir’s semiautonomy, further alienating the Kashmiris.\nIn its response, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Sunday that it appreciates Trump’s willingness to resolve the Kashmir issue, which has implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond.\n“Pakistan reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realization of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination,” it said.\nIndia’s leaders have not directly commented, but Indian media quoted unnamed government sources as saying no decision has yet been made to engage in talks on anything beyond the ceasefire.\nIndia and Pakistan agreed to halt all fighting on Saturday, but Trump was the first person to announce the deal on his online platform.\nIn his post on Sunday, Trump took credit for the ceasefire.\n“I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he wrote.\n“While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations.”\nThe latest fighting between the two neighbours started when India attacked Pakistan in the aftermath of a shooting attack in India-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 civilians at a tourist location.\nNew Delhi again accused Pakistan of backing the “terrorist” groups that have launched many deadly attacks in India-administered Kashmir for decades.\nPakistan strongly denies the charges, maintaining that India has supported “terrorism” in its territory for many years and the Pahalgam attack was a false-flag operation to start a war.\nThe missile, drone and artillery attacks signified the most serious fighting between the two countries since they became nuclear-armed powers decades ago.\n‘Neutral’ site for talks\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday that in addition to the ceasefire, the two countries agreed to conduct broad talks over a host of issues at a “neutral” site soon.\nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said his country believes in the path of peaceful negotiations to resolve problems around distribution of water resources and “all issues, including Jammu and Kashmir”.\nBut India has for decades refused to hold negotiations over the contested region as it has tried to strengthen its hold over it.\nMohmad Waseem Malla, a research fellow at the International Centre for Peace Studies in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera that Trump’s statement, though not entirely surprising, was “striking both in tone and substance” and likely to raise concerns in New Delhi.\n“Any suggestion of third-party involvement, even in passing, crosses a red line for New Delhi – especially under the current government, which has redefined the country’s foreign policy and its emphasis on territorial sovereignty.”\nHe added that while Trump’s mention of boosting trade and promoting peace may seem conciliatory internationally, India’s domestic political climate and strategic priorities make it difficult to entertain such offers right now.\n“The key will be how New Delhi calibrates its response given current sensitivities.”\nThe two countries also have yet to resolve their differences over water distribution as India’s suspension of its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty remains in place.\nIn response to the Pahalgam attack, India also expelled Pakistani diplomats, military advisers and visa holders; closed its main land border crossing and suspended trade; and launched a manhunt for the perpetrators.\nPakistan responded by kicking out Indian officials and citizens, closing its airspace to Indian flights and threatening to pull out of the Simla Agreement, which underpins the Line of Control in Kashmir.",

    "title": "Taiwan faces similar threat to Europe in 1930s, president says",
    "text": "Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries heading for conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a punchy speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe.\n“Eighty years after the end of the European war, the message of history is clear. Today, 80 years later, we share the same values ​​and face similar challenges as many of the democracies that participated in the European war,” Lai said to a group of foreign dignitaries gathered in Taipei.\nLai’s speech comes at a time when Taiwan is facing increasing military pressure from China. It is the first time Taiwan has officially commemorated the end of the second world war in Europe.\nThe conflict is a thorny topic in cross-strait relations. China at the time was ruled by the Kuomintang, or the nationalists, under the banner of the Republic of China.\nDuring the war, the Kuomintang fought alongside the Chinese Communist party (CCP) against the Japanese, before resuming their own civil conflict, which led to the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 and establishing the Republic of China there. This remains the island’s official name. The CCP established the People’s Republic of China in Beijing.\nIn a veiled reference to China, Lai called on “freedom-loving people and countries” to work together to counter authoritarian regimes.\n“Taiwan and Europe are jointly facing the threat of a new totalitarian group,” Lai said. “The bitter experience of world war two tells us that appeasement will only make the invaders more greedy and expand their ambitions.”\nThursday’s event opened with a short video featuring clips of the D-day landings in Normandy and audio recordings of Winston Churchill’s famous “We shall fight on the beaches” speech.\nThe top British representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, spoke at the event, as did Lutz Güllner, the head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan.\nMarcin Jerzewski, the head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security Policy, said Lai was “trying to send the message that security and prosperity of Taiwan and Europe are still interconnected, so that European partners fearing possible withdrawal of American security guarantees from Europe don’t turn away from their engagements with the Indo-Pacific and security in the Taiwan Strait”.\nLai is steering Taiwan through a fraught geopolitical moment. The self-governing island is claimed by China, which has vowed to annex it with the use of force if necessary. Since Donald Trump took office as US president in January, the commitment of the US, Taiwan’s main security backer, to helping Taiwan defend itself has been unclear.\nChina frequently rehearses blockades of Taiwan. So-called “grey zone” tactics such as disinformation campaigns have been increasing.\nWen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said Lai also wanted to show that “Taiwan wants to be a partner, not just a recipient, of western largesse”.\nLai’s speech came the day after China’s president, Xi Jinping, arrived in Moscow for Russia’s commemoration of the end of the second world war, which will be marked with a military parade featuring Chinese troops on Friday.\nChina’s continuing support for Russia’s war in Ukraine has alarmed western leaders and raised concerns that China could be learning lessons for an invasion of Taiwan.\nIn an article published in Russian media on Wednesday about Chinese and Soviet cooperation during the second world war, Xi devoted a lengthy section to the war’s implications for China’s claims on Taiwan.\nXi described this week’s commemorations as “the 80th anniversary of Taiwan’s recovery” to China.\n“No matter how the situation on the island of Taiwan changes, no matter how external forces disrupt it, the historical trend that China will eventually reunify and will definitely reunify is unstoppable,” Xi wrote.\nXi expressed China’s appreciation for Russia’s support for “all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification”.\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "title": "Alcatraz's last living inmate on Trump's plan to reopen prison",
    "text": "One of Alcatraz's last living inmates on Trump's plan to reopen prison\n12 hours ago\nMadeline Halpert\nBBC News, New York\nLily Jamali\nBBC News, Alcatraz Island\nWhen Charlie Hopkins thinks back to the three years he spent in one of America's most famous prisons, he remembers the \"deathly quiet\" the most.\nIn 1955, Hopkins was sent to Alcatraz - a famed prison on an isolated island off the coast of San Francisco - after causing trouble at other prisons to serve a 17-year sentence for kidnapping and robbery.\nFalling asleep at night in his cell on the remote island, he said, the only sound was the whistle of ships passing.\n\"That's a lonely sound,\" Hopkins said. \"It reminds you of Hank Williams singing that song, 'I'm so lonesome I could cry.'\"\nNow 93 and living in Florida, Hopkins said the San Francisco National Archives informed him that he is likely the last surviving former Alcatraz inmate. The BBC could not independently verify this.\nIn an interview with the BBC this week, Hopkins described life at Alcatraz - which formed the setting for the 1996 film The Rock - where he made friends with gangsters and once helped plan an unsuccessful escape.\nAlthough it closed decades ago, US President Donald Trump recently claimed that he wants to re-open it as a federal prison.\nWhen Hopkins was transferred to the high-security prison in 1955, from an Atlanta facility, he remembers it being clean, but barren. And there were few distractions - no radio at the time, and few books, he said.\n\"There was nothing to do,\" he said. \"You could walk back and forth in your cell or do push-ups.\"\nHopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning Alcatraz, sweeping the floors and buffing them \"until they shined\", he said.\nHe was sent to prison in 1952 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his role in a series of robberies and kidnappings. He was part of a group that took hostages to get through roadblocks and steal cars, he said.\nThe men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon\nAt Alcatraz, Hopkins had some infamous neighbours. The facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years - Al Capone; Robert Stroud, a murderer known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"; and crime boss James \"Whitey\" Bulger - making it the subject of a host of films and television shows.\nA 22-acre island, 1.25 miles (2km) off San Francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents, Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort. It was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison. The US Justice Department took it over in the 1930s, transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organised crime at the time.\nEven in the high-security prison, Hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facility's \"D Block\" - solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells.\nHis longest stint there - six months - came after he tried to help several other prisoners, including notorious bank robber Forrest Tucker, escape Alcatraz, Hopkins said. He helped steal hacksaw blades from the prison's electric shop to cut the prison bars in the basement kitchen.\nThe plan didn't work - prison guards discovered the blades in other inmates' cells, Hopkins said. \"A few days after they locked them up, they locked me up,\" he said.\nBut that did not stop one of the inmates.\nIn 1956, when Tucker was taken to a hospital for a kidney operation, he stabbed his ankle with a pencil so prison guards would have to remove his leg irons, Tucker told the New Yorker. Then, as he was taken to get an X-ray, he overpowered hospital orderlies and ran away, he said.\nHe was captured in a hospital gown in a cornfield hours later.\nAs more prisoners attempted to escape Alcatraz over the years, officials ramped up security, Hopkins said.\n\"When I left there in 1958, the security was so tight you couldn't breathe,\" he said.\nAll told, there were 14 separate attempts over the years involving 36 inmates, according to the National Park Service.\nOne of the most famous involved Frank Morris, and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, who escaped in June 1962 by placing papier-mâché heads in their beds and breaking out through ventilation ducts. They were never found, but the FBI concluded that they drowned in the cold waters surrounding the island.\nA year later, the prison shut down after the government determined it would be more cost-effective to build new prisons than to keep the remote island facility in operation.\nNow it's a publicly run museum visited by millions each year that generates about $60m (£45m) a year in revenue for park partners.\nThe building is decrepit, with peeling paint, rusted pipes, and crumbling toilets in each cramped cell. Construction on the main prison facility began in 1907, and more than a century of exposure to the elements has rendered the place all but uninhabitable.\nTrump said this week, however, that he wants his government to re-open and expand the island prison for the country's \"most ruthless and violent offenders\".\nAlcatraz \"represents something very strong, very powerful\" - law and order, Trump said.\nBut experts and historians said Trump's proposal to re-establish the prison is far-fetched, as it would cost billions to repair and bring up to date with other federal facilities.\nHopkins agrees. \"It would be so expensive,\" he said.\n\"Back then, the sewage system went into the ocean,\" he added. \"They'd have to come up with another way of handling that.\"\nHopkins left Alcatraz five years before it closed down for good. He had been transferred to a prison in Springfield, Missouri and given psychiatric medication that improved his behaviour and helped him heal psychological issues, he said.\nBut the avid Trump supporter said he does not believe the president's proposal is serious.\n\"He don't really want to open that place,\" Hopkins said, adding that Trump was trying to \"get a point across to the public\" about punishing criminals and those who enter the US illegally.\nHopkins was released in 1963, working first at a truck stop before taking on other jobs. He went back to his home state of Florida, where now he has a daughter and grandson.\nAfter several decades reflecting on his crimes and life in Alcatraz, he wrote a 1,000-page memoir, with nearly half of the book detailing his troubled behaviour, he said.\n\"You wouldn't believe the trouble I caused them when I was there,\" he said. \"I can see now, looking back, that I had problems.\"",

    "text": "'Perpetual honeymoon' for stranded cruise ship couple married at sea\n8 hours ago\nClaire Graham\nBBC News NI\nThey should have been on a round-the-world cruise for the next three years - instead they were stranded in Belfast.\nThe Villa Vie Odyssey cruise ship was to depart from Northern Ireland last May, but issues with its rudder stocks meant its guests were marooned in the city for more than four months.\nShipmates Angela Harsanyi and Gian Perroni met while commuting daily from hotel accommodation to the ship, where they were allowed to work remotely during the day while repairs were carried out.\nBehind schedule, and on the dry dock, the maintenance work was long enough for the pair of strangers to meet, fall in love and get engaged by the River Lagan.\nThey \"started to become friends, then best friends, and then romance bloomed\", Gian said.\nFrom delays to departure, the next step was \"I do\" - on board the liner itself, off the coast of Costa Rica in April.\nThey got engaged on the banks of the River Lagan in Belfast - and Gian said the location was \"just as exotic\" as Costa Rica.\nIt was to be Angela's first time down the aisle, while Gian has children from a previous marriage.\nThe couple also got matching Celtic trinity knot tattoos.\nThey told BBC News NI the wedding ceremony on board was \"incredible\".\n\"It's been magical, it's beyond my wildest dreams,\" said Angela.\n\"We're on a perpetual honeymoon now, for real.\n\"After we got engaged, he looked at me so sincerely and said, 'you know honey, I'm going to take you on a world cruise for our honeymoon'.\n\"I just cracked up laughing of course, because that's what any woman would want to hear, but it's our life, so it's pretty wonderful. He was a man of his word.\"\n'From Belfast to Forever'\nThe pair had a private ceremony with family and friends on board, before a second ship-wide event with 300 guests the following day, including around 100 of their original Belfast shipmates.\nThey had friends and family fly in \"from the four corners\" to the wedding off the coast of Costa Rica, before sailing north towards central America.\nCelebrations included conga lines, bubble machines, dolphins swimming in the ocean alongside them, and sunsets burning orange on the horizon.\nBelfast delay 'a funny story'\nTheir foundations in Northern Ireland played a part in the nuptials 5,000 miles away.\n\"From Belfast to Forever\" was inscribed on the flooring used as the wedding aisle for Angela to walk down.\nBoth the officiators at the two ceremonies mentioned Belfast in the weddings. The second ceremony was officiated by the ship's captain which the couple described as an \"honour\".\nGian added: \"He was there for the whole four months in Belfast as well, and he understood the frustrations.\n\"At the time it was a sore point - 'we're still here' - but now it's kind of a funny story.\"\nGian said the couple will return to Belfast as soon as they can.\n\"We can't wait to visit again to retrace our steps,\" he said.\n\"I'm half-Irish myself, but I truly understand the luck of the Irish now. It's pretty cool.\"\nThe couple's families had met before the wedding, but it was a chance to meet each other's friends for the first time.\n\"It was really nice to get everyone in one place, and for them to have that destination wedding.\"",

    "title": "How to win the Eurovision Song Contest, according to the experts",
    "text": "How to win Eurovision, according to the experts\n12 hours ago\nSamuel Spencer\nBBC News\nThe Eurovision Song Contest was watched by around 163 million people last year – meaning there are potentially 163 million different opinions on what makes a perfect entrant.\nDo you go for a soulful ballad, guaranteed to leave Europe misty-eyed and full of love and peace?\nOr do you opt for a cheesy extravaganza, complete with saucy takes on regional costumes and eye-popping staging that will have the entire continent (and Australia) raving in their living rooms?\nThe perfect song\nForensic musicologist at Boston's Berklee College of Music Joe Bennett has analysed hundreds of Eurovision finalists, identifying two dominant musical styles.\nOne is the \"Euro-banger\" - high-energy, 120+ BPM songs with kick drums and synth-heavy production, like Sweden's winning entries Euphoria (Loreen, 2012) and Heroes (Måns Zelmerlöw, 2015).\nThe other is the slow-burning ballad - typically around 70 BPM, such as Portugal's Amar Pelos Dois (Salvador Sobral, 2017) and the Netherlands' Arcade (Duncan Laurence, 2019).\nThere is a cliché that Eurovision songs are only about love and peace – reinforced by a song performed during the 2016 contest's interval about writing a perfect Eurovision song, called Love Love Peace Peace.\nAccording to Bennett, there is some validity to this, with every Eurovision song falling under six broad lyrical themes: \"love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history and songs about making music\".\nHe adds that \"songs of self-assertion or lyrical self-empowerment do very well\" - as seen with Austria's 2014 winner Rise Like a Phoenix (Conchita Wurst).\nKeep staging simple and effective\nActs might be tempted to go over the top on staging, but this may not be the way to secure victory, according to our experts.\nSongwriter Thomas Stengaard co-wrote Denmark's 2013 winner Only Teardrops (as well as this year's UK entry What the Hell Just Happened by Remember Monday). He puts his success down, in part, to its simple staging, which he says made it easy to remember.\n\"If you asked a kid to draw that staging, they could. It was a girl with no shoes on, two guys playing the drums and a flute guy. Very simple, but it worked.\"\nVocal coach Carrie Grant, who led the UK's jury in 2014 and came sixth in the contest as part of Sweet Dreams in 1983, agrees.\n\"There is nothing worse than having an artist whose stage has lots of money but their performance doesn't warrant it,\" she says. \"It makes that performance seem worse.\"\nThe 2014 winner (and Carrie's personal favourite) was Conchita Wurst – the first act to win the contest without backing singers or dancers on stage since 1970.\nWhat made Conchita stand out was that she was a bearded drag queen. Carrie believes Eurovision fans love things that are quirky and that \"embrace the LGBT community\".\nBut she adds that Conchita wasn't a gimmick but instead \"a brilliant singer who could deliver what we call in vocal coaching 'money moments'\".\nThe key is key\nMinor-key songs increasingly dominate Eurovision.\nBennett debunks the idea that \"major equals happy, minor equals sad\", adding that \"minor keys are more a shorthand for emotional depth\".\nIn 2023, 85% of finalists performed in minor keys, according to the Press Association. In the last 20 years, only two major-key songs have won - 2011's Running Scared (for Azerbaijan) and 2017's Amar Pelos Dois.\nProfessor Elizabeth Hellmuth Margulis, a researcher in music cognition at Princeton, highlights source sensitivity – our instinct to associate a song's sound with its intended context. A few bars of a techno song, for example, and we have a mental image of a dark nightclub, and of the sort of DJ who might perform there.\nThis means certain minor keys now immediately signal \"Eurovision-ness\" to audiences.\nRemember Monday's What the Hell Just Happened was written at a songwriting camp, with multiple songwriters working together at a countryside retreat to write the perfect song for this year's UK act.\nThe song was intentionally written in a major key to stand out in a sea of minor-key songs - similar to the UK's 2022 second-place entry, Spaceman by Sam Ryder (B Major).\nWitchcraft, innuendo and moody goth boys: Your guide to all 37 of this year’s Eurovision songs\nHave a surprise up your sleeve\nRepetition is important to make a song stick in the mind, says Margulis. But songs should avoid being too repetitive. Margulis says that what particularly makes a song catchy is \"not only when they are heard repeatedly, but also when they throw in some kind of surprise twist\".\nBucks Fizz's 1981 winner for the UK, Making Your Mind Up, is a classic example. First, the song changes key, quickly followed by a memorable costume change in which the female singers' skirts were ripped off to reveal shorter skirts – a joint visual and musical twist.\nEarlier Eurovision winners were often mocked for their nonsense lyrics, like Sweden's 1984 winner Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley, but Bennett argues this highlights Eurovision's strong focus on melody.\n\"Eurovision really needs big melodic hooks. You want people across Europe to be singing that melody. The need for a very accessible, catchy chorus is essential.\"\nKey changes have long been a way to introduce novelty into Eurovision songs. The 2000s saw multiple winners follow this formula, including Olsen Brothers' Fly on the Wings of Love for Norway (2000), and Serbia's Molitva in 2007.\nBut as Bennett points out, though they are still present in around a fifth of finalists, no song with a final chorus key change has won since Molitva almost 20 years ago.\nStengaard's song for this year's UK act Remember Monday is certainly full of surprises. BBC music correspondent Mark Savage said the song featured \"a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts\".\nThe song is the songwriter's answer to the question he asks himself whenever he writes for Eurovision: \"How do you stand out in a contest where everyone wants to stand out?\"",

    "title": "Bangladesh bans activities of Awami League, the party of ousted PM Hasina",
    "text": "The interim government of Bangladesh has banned all activities of the party of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted last year after a student-led uprising.\nThe interim cabinet, headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, decided to ban the Awami League under the Anti-Terrorism Act, Bangladesh’s law affairs adviser, Asif Nazrul, said late on Saturday.\nThe ban would remain in place until the trial of the party and its leadership over the deaths of hundreds of protesters at the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is completed, the government said in the statement.\nAwami League’s student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League, was banned in October after being labelled a “terrorist organisation” for its role in violent attacks on protesters during the uprising.\nThousands of protesters, including supporters of a newly formed students’ party, had been taking to the streets in Dhaka for days to demand a ban on the Awami League.\nThe members of the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party also prominently took part in the protests.\nA mass uprising that began with student-led protests in July last year led to the ousting of Hasina, who had ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist for 15 years.\nUp to 1,400 people may have been killed during three weeks of protests against Hasina and her government, according to a February report by the United Nations human rights office. Hasina and many of her senior party officials have been accused of murder and other offences as a result.\nIn his announcement, Nazrul also said the cabinet expanded the scope for trying any political parties involving charges of killing during the protests.\nThe change to the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act clears the way for the Awami League to be tried as a collective entity for alleged crimes committed during its time in power.\nThe move to ban the party came hours after Nazrul said a Truth and Reconciliation Commission would be formed to underscore national unity. The latest move, political analysts say, will elude the unity needed for a smooth transition of power in this South Asian nation of 170 million people.\nThe National Citizen Party convener, Nahid Islam, who is also a student leader, applauded the government decision.\nBut the Awami League, founded in 1949, dismissed the decision as illegitimate, posting on its official Facebook page: “All decisions of the illegal government are illegal.”\nHasina has been living in exile in India since August 5, with her official residence in Bangladesh also stormed by protesters soon after she left.\nEarlier this month, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia returned to Dhaka after four months of medical treatment in the British capital, London, raising pressure on the interim government to set a date for national elections.\nYunus has pledged reforms to political institutions and said the polls could be delayed until 2026.",

He says generally almost all elections are a 3-3 split.\nBut “right now there is a possibility of a left-right split in five states, with the left leading in four of those states”.\nThe left could possibly win four seats out of every state, except Queensland where a 4-2 right split has become a 3-3 split, and a 2-0 split in the ACT, Rau explains.\nThis would lead to a very clear Labor-Greens majority, with some seats to spare.\nShare\nUpdated at 06.42 BST\nParents who gave birth in the car park of a Queensland police station have returned to thank officers who helped with the delivery.\nConstables Jacob Pennisi and Philippe Stigner were called over to a car in the Deception Bay police station car park after their morning call outs around 6:20am on 1 March, where Julie Pedler was in the late stages of labour.\nJulie and husband Nathaniel Pedler pulled into the station “knowing they did not have enough time to make it to the hospital,” a QLD police statement said.\nStigner helped birth the baby, relaying instructions from a triple zero operator.

    "text": "Finland’s left-wing Prime Minister Sanna Marin conceded defeat on Sunday in the Nordic country’s parliamentary election as the opposition right-wing National Coalition Party (NCP) claimed victory in a tightly fought contest.\nThe pro-business NCP was expected to win 48 of the 200 seats in parliament, narrowly ahead of the nationalist Finns Party with 46 seats and Marin’s Social Democrats on 43 seats, justice ministry election data showed with all ballots counted.\n“We got the biggest mandate,” NCP leader Petteri Orpo said in a speech to followers, vowing to “fix Finland” and its economy.\nHe will get the first chance at forming a coalition to obtain majority in parliament as Marin’s era as prime minister was expected to end.\n“We have gained support, we have gained more seats (in parliament). That’s an excellent achievement, even if we did not finish first today,” the prime minister said in a speech to party members.\nMarin, 37, the world’s youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, but at home she has faced criticism for her partying and her government’s public spending.\nWhile she remains very popular among many Finns, particularly young moderates, she antagonized some conservatives with lavish spending on pensions and education they see as not frugal enough.\nThe NCP has led in polls for almost two years although its lead had melted away in recent months. It has promised to curb spending and stop the rise of public debt, which has reached just over 70% of GDP since Marin took office in 2019.\nOrpo accused Marin of eroding Finland’s economic resilience at a time when Europe’s energy crisis, driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, has hit the country hard and the cost of living has increased.\nOrpo has said he will negotiate with all groups to obtain a majority in parliament, while Marin has said her Social Democrats may govern with the NCP but will not go into government with the Finns Party.\nMarin called the Finns Party “openly racist” during a debate in January – an accusation the nationalist group rejected.\nThe Finns Party’s main goal is to reduce what leader Riikka Purra has called “harmful” immigration from developing countries outside the European Union. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending, a stance it shares with the NCP.\nMost notable of Marin’s foreign policy actions has been her push, along with President Sauli Niinisto, for the country to make a watershed policy U-turn by seeking NATO membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThat process is now almost complete, with Helsinki expected to join within days after all the Western defense alliance’s 30 members approved the accession.",

    "title": "Beijing promised to ‘fight back’ over Taiwan leader Tsai’s US visit. But this time it has more to lose",
    "text": "An anticipated meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaign China launched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.\nAt that time, Beijing encircled the island democracy with unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.\nIt also cut off contact with the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.\nThis time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.\nIt also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to “serious” confrontation between the two powers.\nA defiant Tsai staked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.\nBut the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations and ahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.\n“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.\nThat doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.\nThe opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.\n“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.\nRising pressure\nThe expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office announced earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.\nWashington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed suspected Chinese surveillance balloon to semiconductor supply chains – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.\nTaiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.\nBut a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.\nFor Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.\nThat increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.\nChina’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.\nThe party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.\nThat’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”\nIt is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.\nCongress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.\nWhile the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.\nUnder Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.\nThough McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.\nLast month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.\nBeijing watching\nA meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.\nPelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric in mainland China.\nThis time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.\nBut the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.\nAs Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.\nIt could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member Ma Ying-jeou, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\nMa’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.\nChina is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter global spotlight following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.\nBeijing has recently sought to position itself as an agent of peace in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.\nThis week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.\nAn aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a face-to-face meeting in Bali.\n“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.\n“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”",

    "title": "Israeli military veterans, a backbone of protest movement, vow to keep demonstrating",
    "text": "In a sea of Israeli flags, Yiftach Golov holds one that looks a little different.\nAmong the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.”\nThey are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy.\n“We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies.\nDuring the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University.\nBut when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission.\nSome, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary.\nOthers have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field.\nWhile Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation.\n“We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said.\nFellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests.\nThey’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.\n“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”\nIsrael’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.\nLast Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.\nBut despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.\nLast week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.”\nIn his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security.\nUnder pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.”\n“Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added.\nBut Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said.\nMany protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms.\n“We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said.",

    "title": "A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise",
    "text": "Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the virus gets its first foothold in the body.\nIn experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.\nAlthough this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.\nChina and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.\nHalting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines\nThe US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.\nAs long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.\nResearchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.\nOne way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.\nIt’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.\nThe immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.\n“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.\nMucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.\nThe new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.\nThe researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.\n“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.\nPromising results in animal studies\nIn the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.\nThe researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.\nThe nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.\nAs promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.\n“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.\nThe study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update.\nIt also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.\nOther vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.\nIn reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.\n“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.\nMore on the way\nAt least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, according to the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.\nThe nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.\nTwo other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.\nOne, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.\nAnother, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus. It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix. Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.\nThe German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.\n“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.\nThey have reason to worry. Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.\nFluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.\nStill, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.\nAnother consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone. People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.\n“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.",

    "title": "Marlene Schiappa: French minister under fire for appearing on front cover of Playboy magazine",
    "text": "French government minister Marlene Schiappa has come under fire from members of her own party after appearing on the front cover of Playboy magazine.\nSchiappa, who has been a government minister since 2017, appeared on the cover of the magazine to accompany a 12-page interview she did on women’s and LGBT rights. Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.\nSchiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.\nHer appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.\nBorne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.\nFrance is currently in the throes of a political and social crisis triggered by French President Emmanuel Macron’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition.\n“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.\nFrench politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.\n“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.\nSchiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”\nFrench Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”\n“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.",

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Twitter promised a purge of blue check marks. Instead he singled out one account",
    "text": "Some VIP Twitter users woke up on Saturday expecting to have lost their coveted blue verification check marks in a previously announced purge by Elon Musk. Instead, Twitter appeared to target a single account from a major publication Musk dislikes and changed the language on its site in a way that obscures why users are verified.\nTwitter had said it would “begin winding down” blue checks granted under its old verification system — which emphasized protecting high-profile users at risk of impersonation — on April 1. In order to stay verified, Musk said, users would have to pay $8 per month to join the platform’s Twitter Blue subscription service, which has allowed accounts to pay for verification since December.\nMost legacy blue check holders found this weekend that their verification marks had not disappeared, but rather had been appended with a new label reading: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” The language, which shows up when users click on the check mark, makes it unclear whether verified accounts are actually notable individuals or simply users who have paid to join Twitter Blue.\nBut one high-profile account did lose its blue check over the weekend: the main account for the New York Times, which had previously told CNN it would not pay for verification.\nAfter an account that often engages with Musk posted a meme this weekend about the Times declining to pay for verification, Musk responded in a tweet saying, “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” Musk then lashed out at the Times — just the latest instance of the billionaire slamming journalists or media outlets — in a series of tweets that claimed the outlet’s coverage is boring and “propaganda.”\nThe weekend moves are just the latest example of Twitter creating confusion and whiplash for users over feature changes — and in this case, not just any users, but many of the most high-profile accounts that have long been a key selling point for the platform. It also highlights how Musk often appears to guide decisions about the platform more by whims than by policy.\nAlthough the New York Times’ main account lost its blue check, its other accounts, such as those for its arts, travel and books content, remained verified. (It’s not clear why the New York Times doesn’t have a gold “organizations” check mark, like accounts for other news outlets, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.) After its blue check was removed, a spokesperson for the New York Times reiterated to CNN that it does not plan to pay for verification.\nTwitter, which laid off most of its public relations staff last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a separate puzzling move, Twitter’s blue bird logo at the top of the site was replaced on Monday with doge, the meme representing the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which Musk has promoted. The price of dogecoin shot up 20% on Monday.\nMusk’s long campaign against “legacy” blue checks\nMusk has been threatening to take away “legacy” blue check marks from users verified under Twitter’s old system since shortly after he bought Twitter last fall.\nIn early November, Twitter launched the option for people paying for its Twitter Blue subscription service to receive blue checks. The program was quickly put on pause after being plagued by a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators, and was relaunched in December.\nTwitter also rolled out a color-coded verification system with differently colored marks for companies and government entities, but Musk continued to say that individual users would eventually have to pay for blue checks.\nIn the days leading up to the blue check purge that wasn’t, prominent users such as actor William Shatner and anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinksy pushed back against the idea that, as power users that draw attention to the site, they should have to pay for a feature that keeps them safe from impersonation.\nBy muddying the reason accounts are verified, the new label could risk making it easier for people to scam or impersonate high-profile users. Experts in inauthentic behavior have also said it’s not clear that reserving verification for paid users will reduce the number of bots on the site, an issue Musk has raised on and off over the past year.\nMusk, for his part, has previously presented changes to Twitter’s verification system as a way of “treating everyone equally.”\n“There shouldn’t be a different standard for celebrities,” he said in a tweet last week. The paid feature could also drive revenue, which could help Musk, who is on the hook for significant debt after buying Twitter for $44 billion.\nMusk last week also said that starting on April 15, only verified accounts would be recommended in users’ “For You” feeds alongside the accounts they follow.\n–CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Twitter’s traditional bird icon was booted and replaced with an image of a Shiba Inu, an apparent nod to dogecoin, the joke cryptocurrency that CEO Elon Musk is being sued over.\nMusk addressed the change Monday afternoon, tweeting, “as promised” above an image of a year-old conversation in which another user suggested that Musk “just buy Twitter” and “change the bird logo to a doge.”\nThe doge logo appeared on the site two days after Musk asked a judge to throw out a $258 billion racketeering lawsuit accusing him of running a pyramid scheme to support the dogecoin, according to Reuters.\nLawyers for Musk and Tesla called the lawsuit by dogecoin investors a “fanciful work of fiction” over Musk’s “innocuous and often silly tweets.”\nIt wasn’t clear whether the logo change was permanent. Musk has been known to use Twitter to troll both his fans and his critics.\nThe price of dogecoin, which is typically volatile, was up more than 20% over the past 24 hours, to about 9 cents. It was trading just under 8 cents Monday morning.",

    "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\nAmericans have grown used to corporate executives treading the well-worn paths of the Northeast corridor to convene alongside elected officials in Washington, DC, and discuss geopolitics, policy and all that’s in-between.\nIn 2017, major CEOs from across the country came together to oppose North Carolina’s transgender bathroom law. In 2019, they called abortion bans “bad for business.”\nAfter the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, many of corporate America’s biggest names denounced the rioters and pledged to halt their political giving.\nRecently, more than 1,000 companies promised to voluntarily curtail their operations in Russia in protest of Moscow’s war on Ukraine.\nDick’s Sporting Goods stopped selling semi-automatic, assault-style rifles at stores and Citigroup put new restrictions on gun sales by business customers after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.\nA year later, after mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and a nightclub in Dayton, Ohio, Walmart ended handgun ammunition sales.\nCorporate leadership has long been vocal on the issue of gun control – in 2019 and again this past summer nearly 150 major companies – including Lululemon, Lyft, Bain Capital, Bloomberg LP, Permanente Medical Group and Unilever – called gun violence a “public health crisis” and demanded that the US Senate pass legislation to address it.\nThat’s why corporate America’s silence in the wake of the latest mass shooting at a school in Nashville is so jarring. The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.\nBut Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility who has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said.\nBefore the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nBefore the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?\nJeffrey Sonnenfeld: Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the interfaith activity of clergy locking arms and canvassing legislators. We saw campuses alive and aroused. Where’s all the student activism?\nThe CEOs are still the most active even if they’re less active than they were six months ago. They’re not there as hired hands of shareholders to fill the role of politicians and civic leaders. They’re there to join that chorus, but they don’t want to be the only one singing.\nSo is this what you’re hearing from top CEOs? Have they gotten tired of advocating?\nI just got off of a CEO call on voting rights and this morning we had a forum on sustainability – CEOs are still the most active on these fronts. It’s the same thing on immigration reform. If a CEO was working an 18 hour day on a 12 day week, they still couldn’t address all of the issues that need addressing.\nThe nation’s CEOs are waiting for everybody else to join them. They don’t need to restate something they’ve already stated. They’ve jumped in the pool, where’s everybody else?\nSo what do you think has led to this complacency amongst Americans and the growing reliance on CEOs to advocate on our behalf?\nThey’ve taken a very strong stance and they’ve gone out further than the general public. They are where the general public is on surveys, but they’re not where the general public is on action in the streets. So we’re ready for others to now do something. Enough already on saying ‘what are the CEOs doing?’ Social capital is as valuable as financial capital. CEOs understand that in their soul, they want there to be social capital. They want there to be public trust, but they need the rest of civil society to join them. And that’s their frustration.\nIt sounds like CEOs are frustrated?\nYeah, they’re frustrated.\nBut don’t these CEOs hold the purse strings in terms of donating to powerful politicians?\nYou would think that, but since the 2020 elections much less of campaign contributions have come from big business. Since the 2021 run on the Capitol, a lot of businesses either had an official moratorium or they’ve given mere pennies to politicians. The common impression on the street that CEOs are controlling campaign purses strings is 100% wrong.\nTesla sales again fall short of production\nBy CNN’s Chris Isidore\nTesla reported. a modest 4% rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year, despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.\nThe first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories, one in Texas, the other in Germany, which opened last spring, and a lag between that increased production and sales.\nTesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X, in transit to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to the Asia Pacific region.\nBut it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78,000 more cars than it has sold, suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers.\n“Early this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually generated a huge demand, more than we can produce, really,” said Tom Zhu, Tesla’s executive in charge of global production and sales. “And as Elon said, as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand.”",

    "text": "China Renaissance, a top dealmaker in the country’s tech industry, said it would suspend trading of its shares and delay the release of its annual results because it still can’t get in touch with its founder.\nBao Fan, 52, started the boutique investment bank in 2005 and has been unreachable since the middle of February, according to the company. Shares in China Renaissance have plunged since Bao went missing, at one point dropping as much as 50%.\nChina Renaissance said in late February that it had learned Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” being carried out by certain authorities in the country. It gave no other details.\nChinese media have reported Bao might be assisting in an investigation related to a former executive at China Renaissance.\nIn a filing on Sunday, China Renaissance said auditors couldn’t complete their work or sign off on their report because of Bao’s absence. The board was also unable to give an estimate about when it would be able to approve its audited results for 2022 or dispatch its annual report by an April 30 deadline as required by Hong Kong’s listing rules.\nTrading in the company’s shares was suspended from Monday as a result.\nBao is known as a veteran dealmaker who works closely with top technology companies in China.

    "title": "April 3, 2023 Trump indictment news",
    "text": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped.\nDonald Trump — the first former president in history to face criminal charges — has arrived in New York for an expected arraignment on Tuesday after being indicted last week by a Manhattan grand jury.\nThe former president will stay at Trump Tower tonight, according to a source familiar with his plans. But even before Trump’s appearance, his presence will be felt in the Manhattan courthouse Tuesday, as all trials and most other court activity is being halted before he is slated to arrive.\nHere is what we know about tomorrow’s events:\nThe Secret Service is scheduled to accompany Trump in the early afternoon to the district attorney’s office, which is in the same building as the courthouse.\nTrump will be booked by the investigators, which includes taking his fingerprints. Ordinarily, a mug shot would be taken. But sources familiar with the preparations were uncertain as to whether there would be a mugshot – because Trump’s appearance is widely known and authorities were concerned about the improper leaking of the photo, which would be a violation of state law.\nTypically, after defendants are arrested, they are booked and held in cells near the courtroom before they are arraigned. But that won’t happen with Trump. Once the former president is finished being processed, he’ll be taken through a back set of hallways and elevators to the floor where the courtroom is located. He’ll then come out to a public hallway to walk into the courtroom.\nTrump is not expected to be handcuffed, as he will be surrounded by armed federal agents for his protection.\nBy the afternoon, Trump is expected to be brought to the courtroom, where the indictment will be unsealed and he will formally face the charges. After he is arraigned, Trump will almost certainly be released on his own recognizance. It is possible, though perhaps unlikely, that conditions could be set on his travel.\nOrdinarily, a defendant who is released would walk out the front doors, but Secret Service will want to limit the time and space where Trump is in public. So instead, once the court hearing is over, Trump is expected to walk again through the public hallway and into the back corridors to the district attorney’s office, back to where his motorcade will be waiting.\nThen he’ll head to the airport so he can get back to Mar-a-Lago, where he’s scheduled an event that evening to speak publicly.\nCNN’s John Miller, Jeremy Herb, Katelyn Polantz, Tierney Sneed, Sydney Kashiwagi, Kristen Holmes, Holmes Lybrand, Hannah Rabinowitz, Paula Reid, Alayna Treene, Gregory Clary and Devan Cole contributed reporting to this post.\nLawyers for former President Donald Trump told a New York judge on Monday that they oppose the request by media outlets to broadcast Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday.\nTrump’s attorneys said in their letter to Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan that he is required under court rules to take into account potential security concerns.\n“As Your Honor is well-aware, this case presents extraordinary security concerns (including Secret Service-related concerns) and we submit that any video or photography of the proceedings will only heighten these serious concerns,” they wrote.\nAmong the Trump lawyers signing the new letter was Todd Blanche, who, CNN reported, recently joined the former president’s legal team.\nMeanwhile, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office also responded Monday to the news outlets’ request, and said that it was deferring to the judge to decide how best to manage his court room.\nHowever, the district attorney’s office wrote that it would “be a defensible exercise of the Court’s discretion to exclude or restrict videography, photography, and radio coverage of the arraignment in the interest of avoiding potential prejudice to the defendant, maintaining an orderly proceeding, assuring the safety of the participants in the proceeding, or for other reasons within the Court’s broad authority to manage and control these proceedings.”\nBut the prosecutors also noted that there “does not appear to be a categorical prohibition on cameras during an arraignment” under existing New York statutes and case law.\nWhile the district attorney’s office stopped short of opposing the request, its lawyer pointed out to Merchan that a similar request for audio-video broadcasting was made for the 2021 arraignment in the tax fraud case against Trump Organization and its CFO Allen Weisselberg.\nThe judge responded to that 2021 request by “allowing a limited number of still photographs to be taken prior to the commencement of proceedings,” the prosecutors noted Monday.\nCNN is one of the outlets requesting camera access for Tuesday’s arraignment.\nFormer President Donald Trump has hired a new attorney to serve as lead counsel in his defense against charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, multiple sources tell CNN.\nTrump has hired Todd Blanche, who was most recently a partner at law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. Blanche has previously represented Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Igor Fruman, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani who was also a key figure in Trump’s first impeachment trial. Politico was first to report the news of Blanche’s hiring.\nTrump attorney’s Joe Tacopina and Susan Necheles will remain on Trump’s legal team.\nBlanche’s hiring has been seen by some inside Trump’s orbit as a sidelining of Tacopina, who up until this point has been one of the most forward-facing attorney’s dealing with Trump’s defense. However, a senior adviser to Trump pushed back on that characterization and said the addition of Blanche was intended to add more legal firepower to Trump’s defense.\nWhen pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Friday if Tacopina was the right lawyer in New York to take Trump to trial, another lawyer representing the former president, Tim Parlatore, pointed to a potential conflict of interest.\n“I know that Joe has certain potential conflict issues, given his prior contacts, with Stormy Daniels. So, who’s the right attorney, to take it to trial, is something that the client will have to decide. Ultimately, the decision of who to stand next to, before a jury, is a decision that only the client can make,” Parlatore said.\nAsked by CNN’s Paula Reid if he is still on the case and whether he will be in court tomorrow, Tacopina said: “Yes of course ! And I will be the lead trial lawyer when the bell rings!”\nCNN’s Paula Reid contributed reporting to this post.\nFormer President Donald Trump’s legal team will look to challenge “every potential issue” in his indictment once the charges are unsealed, an attorney for the former president told CNN Sunday.\nTacopina and other Trump lawyers have done several TV interviews in anticipation of the former president’s first appearance in court Tuesday, when he will learn the charges that the Manhattan grand jury has approved against him.\nAt times, the lawyers have vowed to ask for the charges to be dismissed. But the full slate of charges still aren’t known. And crucially, a judge will ultimately determine if the law is sound enough for the case to move forward to trial.\nFormer Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance said in an interview with NBC News on Sunday, “We can speculate on what evidence we think they may or may not have, but even with the indictment published, we really will not know what the district attorney’s evidence is and what they would present at trial.”\nVance’s team investigated the case but did not charge it, leaving it under the purview of his successor, Alvin Bragg.\nWhat we know so far: Trump faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud in the indictment. The investigation by the Manhattan district attorney’s office began when Trump was still in the White House and relates to a $130,000 payment made by his then-personal attorney Michael Cohen to adult film star Stormy Daniels in late October 2016, days before the presidential election, to silence her from going public about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the affair.\nThe Trump team’s court strategy could center around challenging the case because it may rely on business record entries that prosecutors tie to hush money payments to Daniels seven years ago, beyond the statute of limitations for a criminal case.\nTacopina suggested in TV interviews Sunday that the statute of limitations may be passed, and said the Trump businesses didn’t make false entries.\n“They’re not false entries. But assuming they were, they’re misdemeanors way beyond the statute of limitations, so they had to cobble them together to try and get a felony,” he said.\nTacopina on Sunday also said a request to move the case to a different New York City borough isn’t on the table yet for Trump’s legal team.\nAlvin Bragg, a former New York state and federal prosecutor, drew national attention when he made history as the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office first Black district attorney. Now, he is back in the spotlight after a grand jury voted to indict Donald Trump after a yearslong investigation into the former president’s alleged role in a hush money scheme.\nHere’s what you need to know:\nThe Harvard-educated attorney previously served as an assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York, worked as a civil rights lawyer and as a professor and co-director of the New York Law School Racial Justice Project, where he represented family members of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after being placed in an unauthorized chokehold by a then-police officer, in a lawsuit against the City of New York seeking information.\nBragg has aggressively pursued Trump and other progressive priorities so far in his tenure, including not prosecuting some low-level crimes and finding alternatives to incarceration.\nBefore Bragg’s swearing-in last year, he had already worked on cases related to Trump and other notable names in his role as a New York state chief deputy attorney general.\nHe said he had helped sue the Trump administration more than 100 times, as well as led a team that sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which resulted in the former president paying $2 million to a number of charities and the foundation’s dissolution.\nBragg also led the suit against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein and his company, which alleged a hostile work environment.\nBragg emerged the winner in a crowded Democratic primary in the summer of 2021 to lead the coveted Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, for which Vance had announced earlier that year he would not seek reelection. While campaigning, he often spoke about his experience growing up in Harlem, saying he was once a 15-year-old stopped “numerous times at gunpoint by police.”\nBragg ran as a reformer, releasing a memo just days after taking office detailing new charging, bail, plea and sentencing policies – a plan that drew criticism from police union leaders. He said his office would not prosecute marijuana misdemeanors, fare evading and prostitution, among other crimes.\nAlina Habba, an attorney representing former President Donald Trump in several civil matters, argued Trump shouldn’t need to take a mugshot, telling CNN This Morning, “There’s no need for theatrics.”\nHabba told host Don Lemon, “Mugshots are for people so that you recognize who they are. He’s the most recognized face in the world, let alone the country, right now, so there’s no need for that.”\nSources familiar with the preparations were uncertain as to whether there would be a mugshot.\nTrump’s attorney says she believes that the indictment will be unsealed “no matter what,” and accused Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of leaking the number of counts in the indictment.\nWhen pressed by host Don Lemon about the claim, Habba declared, “it’s not speculation.”\nOn Trump’s social media posts attacking the judge in the case, Habba said, “We have many judges, frankly, and I’m before some of them, who have shown a venomous vitriol against President Trump that is like nothing we’ve ever seen in the state of New York.”\nShe also called Bragg a “woke DA who’s now bringing a misdemeanor stacking it and trying to make it a felony” and dismissed the looming indictment as “30-34 counts of garbage.”\nWhen asked about her role in searching Mar-a-Lago for documents, Habba said she wasn’t looking for classified documents, adding, “I was looking for tax documents in another garbage case by [New York Attorney General] Leticia James.”\nWhen pressed by Lemon about the accuracy of these claims, Habba responded, “I’m not in a deposition right now and I’m not going to continue this conversation.” She said her affidavit “is very public and I recommend you read it.”\n“Yes, that’s not a secret. I testified to the grand jury,” she acknowledged.\nSixty percent of Americans approve of the indictment of former President Donald Trump, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS following the news that a New York grand jury voted to charge him in connection with hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\nAbout three-quarters of Americans say politics played at least some role in the decision to indict Trump, including 52% who said it played a major role.\nHere’s how views about the indictment break down by political affiliation:\nIndependents largely line up in support of the indictment — 62% approve of it and 38% disapprove.\nDemocrats are near universal in their support for the indictment — 94% approve, including 71% who strongly approve of the indictment.\nRepublicans are less unified in opposition — 79% disapprove, with 54% strongly disapproving.\nWhile views on the indictment are split along party lines, the poll finds that majorities across major demographic divides all approve of the decision to indict the former president. That includes gender (62% of women, 58% of men), racial and ethnic groups (82% of Black adults, 71% of Hispanic adults, 51% of White adults), generational lines (69% under age 35; 62% age 35-49; 53% age 50-64; 54% 65 or older) and educational levels (68% with college degrees, 56% with some college or less).\nA scant 10% overall see Trump as blameless regarding payments made to Daniels, but Americans are divided about whether his actions were illegal or merely unethical. About 4 in 10 say he acted illegally (37%), 33% unethically but not illegally, and another 20% say they aren’t sure. Only 8% of political independents say Trump did nothing wrong, and among the rest, they are mostly on board with the indictment even if they aren’t already convinced Trump did something illegal.\nThe survey suggests that the indictment has not had a major effect on views of Trump personally. The poll finds his favorability rating at 34% favorable to 58% unfavorable, similar to his standing in a January CNN poll, in which 32% held a favorable view of the former president and 63% an unfavorable one. Among Republicans, 72% hold a favorable view in the new poll, similar to the 68% who felt that way in January.\nNote: The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS on March 31 and April 1 among a random national sample of 1,048 adults surveyed by text message after being recruited using probability-based methods. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. It is larger for subgroups.\nCorrection: This post has been updated to reflect the correct percentage of independents who approve of the indictment of former President Donald Trump.\nFormer President Donald Trump is headed to New York this week for an expected arraignment on Tuesday after being indicted last week by a Manhattan grand jury. Here is what we know:\nWhat will it look like and will Trump be handcuffed?\nTrump is expected to leave Florida around noon ET on Monday, and land at New York’s LaGuardia Airport around 3 p.m. ET, according to a source familiar with his plans.\nHe will stay at Trump Tower Monday night, the source said.\nThe Secret Service, the New York Police Department and the court officers are coordinating security for Trump’s expected appearance. The Secret Service is scheduled to accompany Trump in the early afternoon to the district attorney’s office, which is in the same building as the courthouse.\nTrump is expected to be brought to the courtroom by Tuesday afternoon, where the indictment will be unsealed and he will formally face the charges. All trials and other activity at the Manhattan courthouse are being halted before he is slated to arrive.\nThe former president will be booked by the investigators, which includes taking his fingerprints. Ordinarily, a mug shot would be taken. But sources familiar with the preparations were uncertain as to whether there would be a mugshot – because Trump’s appearance is widely known and authorities were concerned about the improper leaking of the photo, which would be a violation of state law.\nTypically, after defendants are arrested, they are booked and held in cells near the courtroom before they are arraigned. But that won’t happen with Trump. He will almost certainly be released on his own recognizance. It is possible, though perhaps unlikely, that conditions could be set on his travel.\nTrump is not expected to be handcuffed, as he will be surrounded by armed federal agents for his protection.\nOrdinarily, a defendant who is released would walk out the front doors, but Secret Service will want to limit the time and space where Trump is in public. So instead, once the court hearing is over, Trump is expected to walk again through the public hallway and into the back corridors to the district attorney’s office, back to where his motorcade will be waiting.\nHe is expected to depart New York immediately after Tuesday’s arraignment to head back to Florida, the source said. He has scheduled an event that evening to speak publicly.\nWill the arraignment be televised? Several media outlets, including CNN, have asked a New York judge to unseal the indictment and for permission to broadcast Trump’s expected appearance in the courtroom on Tuesday. If the judge does not grant the media outlets’ unsealing request, it is expected that the indictment will be made public when Trump appears in court.\nWho’s the presiding judge? Judge Juan Merchan is no stranger to Trump’s orbit. Merchan, an acting New York Supreme Court justice, has sentenced Trump’s close confidant Allen Weisselberg to prison, presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial and overseen former adviser Steve Bannon’s criminal fraud case.\nMerchan does not stand for disruptions or delays, attorneys who have appeared before him told CNN, and he’s known to maintain control of his courtroom even when his cases draw considerable attention. Trump attorney Timothy Parlatore said during an interview Friday on CNN that Merchan was “not easy” on him when he tried a case before him but that he will likely be fair.\nHow might Trump’s team fight the charges? Trump attorney Joe Tacopina told CNN’s Dana Bash Sunday that the former president will plead not guilty. His team “will look at every potential issue that we will be able to challenge, and we will challenge,” Tacopina said.\nThe Trump team’s court strategy could center around challenging the case because it may rely on business record entries that prosecutors tie to hush money payments to Daniels seven years ago, beyond the statute of limitations for a criminal case. Tacopina suggested in TV interviews Sunday the statute of limitations may have passed, and said the Trump businesses didn’t make false entries.\nHow is this affecting the Trump campaign? Trump’s team says it has raised more than $5 million dollars since he was indicted Thursday. Despite the initial shock of the indictment, the former president has remained surprisingly calm and focused in the days ahead of his court appearance, CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported.\nCNN’s John Miller, Jeremy Herb, Katelyn Polantz, Tierney Sneed, Sydney Kashiwagi, Kristen Holmes, Holmes Lybrand, Hannah Rabinowitz, Paula Reid, Alayna Treene, Gregory Clary and Devan Cole contributed to this report.\nDonald Trump will take America through yet another grave and unprecedented national drama this week when he becomes the first ex-president to appear in court charged with a crime.\nThe 45th president is expected to turn himself in on Tuesday in Manhattan, the stage where he built his legend as a brash popular culture figure and real estate magnate but which could now, in the case of “The People of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump,” engineer his downfall.\nIn what will be extraordinary scenes, Trump will return to New York after a grand jury voted to indict him last week in a case involving a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. His appearance, accompanied by Secret Service agents, will come as he fires up his 2024 campaign for the White House. Trump plans to make a make a speech when he gets back to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night in which he will seek to leverage political advantage out of a perilous, personal legal crisis.\nYet a criminal indictment takes Trump into unique political territory. And however the case turns out, his return to the spotlight in these circumstances is another twist in an exhausting saga featuring a double impeachment, false claims of a stolen election, and a mob attack on the US Congress during an unruly four-year presidency that pushed the nation to the point of exhaustion and deepened its polarization.\nSome legal experts, without having seen the still-sealed indictment, have questioned whether a case that appears to revolve around infringements of accounting practices and possible campaign finance violations is sufficiently serious to merit the historical step of indicting an ex-president who is already running again.\nAt the same time, it is ultimately Trump’s norm-busting behavior that pushed the country to this somber moment. He’s also being investigated over efforts to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia, and by a special counsel probing his hoarding of classified documents and conduct in the run up to January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. In several of these cases, Trump could face even more serious legal problems than in the Stormy Daniels matter, but that case is the only one so far that has yielded an indictment.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases. But once more, America’s political and legal systems, under a near-constant stress test since he came down the escalator in Trump Tower to launch his campaign in 2015, will be put under enormous pressure that is likely to only deepen the country’s internal estrangement.\nSeveral media outlets, including CNN, have asked a New York judge to unseal the grand jury indictment against former President Donald Trump. The news organizations are also asking for permission to broadcast Trump’s expected appearance in a Manhattan courtroom Tuesday for his arraignment on the charges.\nIn their letter Friday seeking to make the indictment public, the media outlets told Judge Juan Merchan – who is slated to preside over the historic proceedings – that “the right of access is at its zenith when applied to the first ever indictment of a former U.S. president.”\nThe New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal are among the outlets making the request.\nIf the judge does not grant the media outlets’ unsealing request, it is expected that the indictment will be made public when Trump appears in court Tuesday.\nMerchan is expected to issue an order Monday on camera access in the courtroom for the arraignment. On Sunday, he invited lawyers for Trump and for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to submit by 1 p.m. Monday any concerns or objections to the media outlets’ request to broadcast the arraignment.\nThe news organizations are asking for a “limited number of photographers, videographers, and radio journalists to be present at the arraignment,” and said in the letter that they are making “this limited request for audio-visual coverage in order to ensure that the operations of the Court will not be disrupted in any way.”\nWhen Donald Trump enters a New York courtroom Tuesday, he’ll face a seasoned judge who is no stranger to the former president’s orbit.\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan has sentenced Trump’s close confidant Allen Weisselberg to prison, presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial and overseen former adviser Steve Bannon’s criminal fraud case.\nBut Trump’s historic arraignment can be viewed as Merchan’s most high-profile case to date, even after a long career atop the state-level trial court.\nMerchan has been described by observers as a “tough” judge, yet one who is fair, no matter who is before him.\nHere’s more background on the justice whose courtroom will soon be thrust into the spotlight:\nBorn in Bogota, Colombia, Merchan emigrated to the United States at the age of six and grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens, according to a New York Times profile of the judge. He was the first in his family to go to college.\nMerchan initially studied business at Baruch College in New York. He dropped out of school to go work, only to return several years later to finish school so that he could get his law degree, the Times reported.\nHe eventually received his law degree from Hofstra University.\nAttorneys who have appeared before him told CNN that Merchan does not stand for disruptions or delays, and he’s known to maintain control of his courtroom even when his cases draw considerable attention.\nTrump attorney Timothy Parlatore said during an interview Friday on CNN that Merchan was “not easy” on him when he tried a case before him, but said the judge likely will be fair.\n“I’ve tried a case in front of him before. He could be tough. I don’t think it’s necessarily going to be something that’s going to change his ability to evaluate the facts and the law in this case,” Parlatore said.\nRead more here.",

    "title": "The haunting Masters meltdown that changed Rory McIlroy’s career",
    "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was originally published in April 2023.\nSlumped on his club, head buried in his arm, Rory McIlroy looked on the verge of tears.\nThe then-21-year-old had just watched his ball sink into the waters of Rae’s Creek at Augusta National and with it, his dream of winning The Masters, a dream that had looked so tantalizingly close mere hours earlier.\nAs a four-time major winner and one of the most decorated names in the sport’s history, few players would turn down the chance to swap places with McIlroy heading into Augusta this week.\nYet on Sunday afternoon of April 10, 2011, not a golfer in the world would have wished to be in the Northern Irishman’s shoes.\nFlying\nA fresh-faced, mop-headed McIlroy had touched down in Georgia for the first major of the season with a reputation as the leading light of the next generation of stars.\nAn excellent 2010 had marked his best season since turning pro three years earlier, highlighted by a first PGA Tour win at the Quail Hollow Championship and a crucial contribution to Team Europe’s triumph at the Ryder Cup.\nYet despite a pair of impressive top-three finishes at the Open and PGA Championship respectively, a disappointing missed cut at The Masters – his first at a major – served as ominous foreshadowing.\nMcIlroy shot 74 and 77 to fall four strokes short of the cut line at seven-over par, a performance that concerned him enough to take a brief sabbatical from competition.\nBut one year on in 2011, any lingering Masters demons looked to have been exorcised as McIlroy flew round the Augusta fairways.\nHaving opened with a bogey-free seven-under 65 – the first time he had ever shot in the 60s at the major – McIlroy pulled ahead from Spanish first round co-leader Alvaro Quirós with a second round 69.\nIt sent him into the weekend holding a two-shot cushion over Australia’s Jason Day, with Tiger Woods a further stroke behind and back in the hunt for a 15th major after a surging second round 66.\nAnd yet the 21-year-old leader looked perfectly at ease with having a target on his back. Even after a tentative start to the third round, McIlroy rallied with three birdies across the closing six holes to stretch his lead to four strokes heading into Sunday.\nThe youngster was out on his own ahead of a bunched chasing pack comprising Day, Ángel Cabrera, K.J. Choi and Charl Schwartzel. After 54 holes, McIlroy had shot just three bogeys.\n“It’s a great position to be in … I’m finally feeling comfortable on this golf course,” McIlroy told reporters.\n“I’m not getting ahead of myself, I know how leads can dwindle away very quickly. I have to go out there, not take anything for granted and go out and play as hard as I’ve played the last three days. If I can do that, hopefully things will go my way.\n“We’ll see what happens tomorrow because four shots on this golf course isn’t that much.”\nFalling\nThe truth can hurt, and McIlroy was about to prove his assessment of Augusta to be true in the most excruciating way imaginable.\nHis fourth bogey of the week arrived immediately. Having admitted to expecting some nerves at the first tee, McIlroy sparked a booming opening drive down the fairway, only to miss his putt from five feet.\nThree consecutive pars steadied the ship, but Schwartzel had the wind in his sails. A blistering birdie, par, eagle start had seen him draw level at the summit after his third hole.\nA subsequent bogey from the South African slowed his charge, as McIlroy clung onto a one-shot lead at the turn from Schwartzel, Cabrera, Choi, and a rampaging Woods, who shot five birdies and an eagle across the front nine to send Augusta into a frenzy.\nDespite his dwindling advantage and the raucous Tiger-mania din ahead of him, McIlroy had responded well to another bogey at the 5th hole, draining a brilliant 20-foot putt at the 7th to restore his lead.\nThe fist pump that followed marked the high-water point of McIlroy’s round, as a sliding start accelerated into full-blown free-fall at the par-four 10th hole.\nHis tee shot went careening into a tree, ricocheting to settle between the white cabins that separate the main course from the adjacent par-three course. It offered viewers a glimpse at a part of Augusta rarely seen on broadcast, followed by pictures of McIlroy anxiously peering out from behind a tree to track his follow-up shot.\nThough his initial escape was successful, yet another collision with a tree and a two-putt on the green saw a stunned McIlroy eventually tap in for a triple bogey. Having led the field one hole and seven shots earlier, he arrived at the 11th tee in seventh.\nBy the time his tee drive at the 13th plopped into the creek, all thoughts of who might be the recipient of the green jacket had long-since switched away from the anguished youngster. It had taken him seven putts to navigate the previous two greens, as a bogey and a double bogey dropped him to five-under – the score he had held after just 11 holes of the tournament.\nMercifully, the last five holes passed without major incident. A missed putt for birdie from five feet at the final hole summed up McIlroy’s day, though he was given a rousing reception as he left the green.\nMere minutes earlier, the same crowd had erupted as Schwartzel sunk his fourth consecutive birdie to seal his first major title. After starting the day four shots adrift of McIlroy, the South African finished 10 shots ahead of him, and two ahead of second-placed Australian duo Jason Day and Adam Scott.\nMcIlroy’s eight-over 80 marked the highest score of the round. Having headlined the leaderboard for most of the week, he finished tied-15th.\nBounce-back\nTears would flow during a phone call with his parents the following morning, but at his press conference, McIlroy was upbeat.\n“I’m very disappointed at the minute, and I’m sure I will be for the next few days, but I’ll get over it,” he said.\n“I was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go, and I just unraveled … It’s a Sunday at a major, what it can do.\n“This is my first experience at it, and hopefully the next time I’m in this position I’ll be able to handle it a little better. I didn’t handle it particularly well today obviously, but it was a character-building day … I’ll come out stronger for it.”\nOnce again, McIlroy would be proven right.\nJust eight weeks later in June, McIlroy rampaged to an eight-shot victory at the US Open. Records tumbled in his wake at Congressional, as he shot a tournament record 16-under 268 to become the youngest major winner since Tiger Woods at The Masters in 1997.\nThe historic victory kickstarted a golden era for McIlroy. After coasting to another eight-shot win at the PGA Championship in 2012, McIlroy became only the third golfer since 1934 to win three majors by the age of 25 with triumph at the 2014 Open Championship.\nBefore the year was out, he would add his fourth major title with another PGA Championship win.\nAnd much of it was owed to that fateful afternoon at Augusta. In an interview with the BBC in 2015, McIlroy dubbed it “the most important day” of his career.\n“If I had not had the whole unravelling, if I had just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one, I would not have learned as much.\n“Luckily, it did not take me long to get into a position like that again when I was leading a major and I was able to get over the line quite comfortably. It was a huge learning curve for me and I needed it, and thankfully I have been able to move on to bigger and better things.\n“Looking back on what happened in 2011, it doesn’t seem as bad when you have four majors on your mantelpiece.”\nThe missing piece\nMcIlroy’s contentment came with a caveat: it would be “unthinkable” if he did not win The Masters in his career.\nYet as he prepares for his 15th appearance at Augusta National this week, a green jacket remains an elusive missing item from his wardrobe.\nDespite seven top-10 finishes in his past 10 Masters outings, the trophy remains the only thing separating McIlroy from joining the ranks of golf immortals to have completed golf’s career grand slam of all four majors in the modern era: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.\nA runner-up finish to Scottie Scheffler last year marked McIlroy’s best finish at Augusta, yet arguably 2011 remains the closest he has ever been to victory. A slow start in 2022 meant McIlroy had begun Sunday’s deciding round 10 shots adrift of the American, who teed off for his final hole with a five-shot lead despite McIlroy’s brilliant 64 finish.\nAt 33 years old, time is still on his side. Though 2022 extended his major drought to eight years, it featured arguably his best golf since that golden season in 2014.\nAnd as McIlroy knows better than most, things can change quickly at Augusta National.",

    "text": "At least 21 people have been killed and many others injured when a bus carrying dozens of Buddhist pilgrims in central Sri Lanka careened off a cliff, according to authorities.\nThe crash took place early on Sunday in a mountainous area near the town of Kotmale, about 140km (86 miles) east of the capital, Colombo.\n“Twenty one have died and we are trying to identify the victims,” Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways Prasanna Gunasena told local media.\nThe toll could have been higher, the minister added, if not for local residents helping pull people from the mangled wreckage and rushing them to hospital.\nTelevision footage showed the bus overturned at the bottom of a precipice while volunteers helped rescue injured people from the rubble.\nThe roof and side panels of the bus were sheared off, and more than half the seats were ripped from the floor of the vehicle, which landed wheels up into a tea plantation, photos of the wreckage showed.\nPolice said 24 people were being treated in two hospitals.\nOne survivor told a local journalist that he had been in the front section of the bus and was lucky to have escaped with only minor injuries.\n“The bus was leaning to the left side and as the driver was negotiating a bend, he lost control and it fell down the precipice,” said the man, who did not give his name, in a video seen by AFP news agency.\nThe vehicle, operated by a state-run bus company, was travelling from the pilgrim town of Kataragama in the south to the central city of Kurunegala, about 250km (155 miles) away.",

    "title": "Edwards, Timberwolves overcome Warriors in Game 3 to take 2-1 series lead",
    "text": "Anthony Edwards poured in a game-high 36 points, Julius Randle had 24 as part of a triple-double, and the Minnesota Timberwolves wrested back home-court advantage in their second-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors with a 102-97 triumph in San Francisco, California.\nGame 4 in the Western Conference best-of-seven series is scheduled for Monday night in San Francisco, with the sixth-seeded Timberwolves leading 2-1.\nJimmy Butler III had a team-high 33 points on Saturday for seventh-seeded Golden State, which played without star guard Stephen Curry, out with a strained left hamstring.\nThe tightly contested game saw the Warriors clinging within 84-82 before two game-disqualifying fouls on defensive ace Draymond Green within 18 seconds inside the final five minutes.\nThe Timberwolves took control from there, getting a triple from Jaden McDaniels and a three-point play from Rudy Gobert, the latter creating a six-point cushion for the visitors with 2:05 to play.\n“We’re making some shots, for sure,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We’re getting stops. We were getting stops throughout the regular season. We’re just winning the possession battle in clutch time now. We’re just not — we’re not giving the ball back on cheap turnovers. We’re not giving up as many or any second-chance opportunities.”\nA 3-pointer by Edwards, his fifth of the game, all but clinched Minnesota’s second consecutive win with 1:19 to go.\nEdwards’s 36 points were his second-most this postseason, topped only by a 43-point explosion in Game 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. He hit 13 of his 28 shots on Saturday.\n“The team defence was really good,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “Held them to 102. That’s a pretty good number. But Randle and Edwards really both got going in the second half, and that was the key. We couldn’t quite contain them, especially in the fourth, and that was the difference.”\nRandle complemented his 24 points with 10 rebounds, a game-high 12 assists and three steals for the Timberwolves, who outshot the hosts 43.9 percent to 43.2 percent in a defensive struggle.\n“He’s playing with so much force and determination,” Finch said of Randle. “He’s going out there early and aggressive, and he’s exerting a tonne of energy on the defensive end with his body and his rebounding. He’s playing a complete game for us, no doubt.”\nMcDaniels added 15 points and Gobert had a game-high 13 rebounds for Minnesota, which went 2-1 on the road in its 4-1 first-round series win against the Lakers.\nButler’s 33 points on 12-for-26 shooting were his most since he had 35 for the Miami Heat in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals at Boston in 2023. He also found time for seven rebounds and a team-high seven assists.\n“Man, Jimmy was incredible,” Kerr said. “He really controlled the game for us and put us in a position to win, and we just couldn’t close it out. But he was brilliant all night.”\nJonathan Kuminga, pressed into increased playing time as the Warriors looked to fill the void of Curry’s regular scoring, backed Butler with a postseason career-high 30 points. He had totalled just 43 in Golden State’s first nine playoff games.\n“JK [Jonathan Kuminga] played one of the best games of his life,” Kerr said. “It was fantastic to see. You can see how necessary he is in this matchup, especially without Steph [Curry].”\nBuddy Hield shot 4-for-8 on 3-pointers to account for a majority of his 14 points for the Warriors, while Brandin Podziemski collected a team-high eight rebounds on a night when he shot 1-for-10.\nCeltics bury Knicks in Game 3\nIn an earlier playoff game on Saturday, Jayson Tatum finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and the Boston Celtics pulled away for a 115-93 win over the host New York Knicks in Game 3 of their second-round Eastern Conference series.\nPayton Pritchard scored a team-high 23 points off the bench for Boston, which cut the Knicks’ lead to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Jaylen Brown added 19 points, and Derrick White had 17.\nJalen Brunson scored 27 points on 9-for-21 shooting to lead the Knicks. Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 21 points and 15 rebounds.\nAfter struggling to score in the first two games of the series, the Celtics found their rhythm on offence. Boston shot 48.2 percent (40 of 83) overall and 50 percent (20 of 40) from 3-point range, and New York shot 40 percent (32 of 80) from the field and 20 percent (5 of 25) from beyond the arc.\n“They got some clean looks early, and they see it go in; that gives them confidence. Then it’s hard to shut them off,” said Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau. “We have to have greater awareness. We can’t allow missed shots to take away from [our] defensive tenacity. We’ve got to bounce back.”\nTatum made a basket to put Boston on top 112-89 with 2:40 remaining. He assisted on a 3-pointer by Al Horford on the next possession, and Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla rested his starters for the remainder of the game with the score out of reach.\n“This is the fun part. You don’t get into the journey for it to be easy,” said Mazzulla. “It’s been dark, but in a good way. You’ve just got to tap into your darkness, and that’s it.”\nGame 4 in the best-of-seven series will be played in New York on Monday.",

    "title": "Mexico sues Google over changing Gulf of Mexico’s name for US users",
    "text": "Mexico has sued Google for changing the Gulf of Mexico’s name to “Gulf of America” for Google Maps users in the United States, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said on Friday.\n“The lawsuit has already been filed,” Sheinbaum said at her morning news conference, without saying where and when it was submitted.\nOn Thursday, Republicans in the House of Representatives approved legislation to codify Donald Trump’s policy of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”.\nThe measure was sponsored by rightwing Georgia lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene and passed nearly along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican, with the exception of vulnerable Nebraska representative Don Bacon, voting in favor.\nThe bill would make the name change official for federal agencies, but it’s unlikely to attract the Democratic support needed to pass the Senate. Even if it did, other countries have no obligation to use the new name.\nSheinbaum had warned Google, which is part of tech giant Alphabet, in February that she was considering legal action unless the company reversed its decision.\nHer government argues that Trump’s executive order on the subject only applies to the part of the continental shelf belonging to the United States.\n“All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,” Sheinbaum said.\n“The US government only calls the portion of the US continental shelf the Gulf of America, not the entire gulf, because it wouldn’t have the authority to name the entire gulf,” she added.\nIn response to Trump, Sheinbaum has cheekily suggested calling the United States “América Mexicana” – Mexican America, pointing to a map dating back to before 1848, when one-third of her country was seized by the United States.\nThe neighboring countries are in talks to defuse tensions over Trump’s global trade war, which has included a series of tariff announcements targeting Mexico.\nWith reporting by Agence France-Press",

    "title": "Ukraine ready to meet Russia but only if ceasefire agreed, says Zelenskyy",
    "text": "Ukraine is open to direct talks with Russia later this week but only if Moscow signs up to an unconditional ceasefire first, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, responding to Vladimir Putin’s overnight suggestion of negotiations in Turkey.\n“There is no point in continuing the killing even for a single day. We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire – full, lasting and reliable – starting tomorrow, May 12, and Ukraine is ready to meet,” Ukraine’s president said in a post on X on Sunday morning.\nHis chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, was clearer in a Telegram post, in response to Putin’s suggestion that Ukrainian and Russian delegations should meet this Thursday in Istanbul: “First a 30-day ceasefire, then everything else.”\nThe demand for a 30-day ceasefire was set out on Saturday during a four-way visit to Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, who together with Zelenskyy made a phone call to the US president, Donald Trump, before holding a joint press conference.\nIf Putin rejected the offer, said the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, “we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions, and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressure Russia back to the table”.\nThe Russian president’s response to the ultimatum came in the unusual form of a statement read out to journalists in a ceremonial Kremlin room close to 2am local time (midnight BST). He accused Ukraine of breaking previous ceasefires, but said that “despite this” he was suggesting the two parties meet for talks, which he said could take place in Istanbul this Thursday. “We are ready for serious talks with Ukraine, and we want to solve the root causes of the conflict,” said Putin.\nHis tone appeared carefully calibrated to reject Europe’s demands but also make Moscow appear to be playing constructively in the eyes of the Trump administration, which has tended to be much softer on Moscow than on Kyiv until recent days. Putin made a point of thanking the new administration for its efforts to solve the conflict.\nTrump’s initial response, posted on the Truth Social network a few hours later, suggested this tactic may have worked. The US president wrote: “A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine! Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending ‘bloodbath’ hopefully comes to an end. It will be a whole new, and much better, WORLD.”\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, however, took a different line, writing on X on Sunday morning that no talks would be possible until Putin agreed to the ceasefire.\n“President Zelensky committed without setting any condition. We now expect an equally clear response from Russia. There can be no negotiations while weapons are speaking. There can be no dialogue if, at the same time, civilians are being bombed,” he wrote.\nThe flurry of back-and-forth offers and ultimatums suggests fast-moving diplomacy around the conflict, but behind the rhetoric it is not clear how much of the fundamental positions of the two sides have changed.\nUkraine and its European allies are demanding a full ceasefire, after which negotiations would then start on a comprehensive settlement including a European “reassurance force” inside Ukraine.\nPutin, on the other hand, has little interest in an unconditional ceasefire, and instead wants to keep fighting to increase the pressure on Ukraine to sign up to a number of Moscow’s core demands, which have changed little since the start of the war. As well as territorial claims to the regions it occupies, Moscow is expected to demand guarantees over Ukraine’s future political and military decisions. The Kremlin has already made it clear it would not accept western troops stationed in Ukraine.\nMuch of what happens now may depend on what position Trump takes, and whether the European leaders who visited Kyiv on Saturday are able to persuade him of their view that direct negotiations while fighting is continuing are unlikely to be advantageous to Ukraine.\nIn the hours after Putin’s address, Russia launched more than 100 drones at Ukraine, as a three-day ceasefire unilaterally declared by Putin came to an end.",

    "title": "‘The pope is Peruvian’: elation in country where pontiff served as bishop",
    "text": "The election of Pope Leo XIV has been celebrated across Latin America, where many hailed him as the second pontiff from the region, after his Argentinian predecessor, Francis.\nThe news prompted particular elation in Peru, where he lived and worked for more than 20 years and was granted citizenship in 2015. In the capital, Lima, the bells of the cathedral rang in celebration.\nIn his first appearance from the Vatican balcony, Leo XIV briefly switched from Italian to Spanish to address the faithful “from my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru”, where he served as bishop for more than a decade.\nPeru’s president, Dina Boluarte, hailed the “historic” election of Leo XIV, whom she described as a Peruvian “by choice and conviction” who had devoted more than 20 years of service to the country. She added that Prevost, 69, “chose to be one of us, to live among us and to carry in his heart the faith, culture and dreams of this country”.\nShe added: “The pope is Peruvian; God loves Peru.”\nEven so, Prevost has spoken out against Boluarte’s government in the past. In early 2023, he described his “sadness and pain” over the deaths of 49 protesters in anti-government demonstrations that erupted when President Boluarte took office in December 2022, replacing Pedro Castillo who was forced out for attempting to suspend congress.\nAt the time Prevost said the unrest reflected the historic neglect of Peru’s poor, saying: “This conflict does not represent the best of the country.”\nPope Leo also called on late former president Alberto Fujimori, who was jailed in 2009 for human rights abuses and corruption to ask for forgiveness from each of his government’s victims in order to begin a process of reconciliation.\nHis suggestion came just two days after Fujimori was given a presidential pardon as part of a political deal and released a video with a half-hearted apology. Prevost pointedly suggested “it would be more effective to ask for forgiveness, personally, for some of the great injustices that were committed and for which he was tried and sentenced”.\nThe controversial ex-leader was sent back to jail in 2018, only to be pardoned again in 2023 amid street protests. He died in 2024 and was given a state funeral.\nRosa María Vílchez, 49, who is originally from Chiclayo but now lives in Lima, met Prevost when attending a church service a few years ago.\n“We knew him by name,” she recalls. “Today I remembered that when I saw him and I really felt like crying because he moved me. He transmits a lot of peace,” said Vílchez, who was collecting her children from school in Villa El Salvador, in the south of the capital.\n“I hope that he brings a little peace, that he can stabilise the country in some way, because Peruvians are, mainly, very faithful and very Catholic. So, I think he is going to be a figure of political authority,” she added.\nCecilia Durand, 55, a publisher in Lima, said: “I’m not Catholic, in fact, there are many things about the church that I am against, but I think this is a good thing for Peru. It’s like winning the World Cup!”\nAs news of Leo’s election began to sink in, social media in Peru was flooded with memes of the pope eating ceviche, Peru’s flagship dish, and drinking Inca Kola, its bubblegum-flavoured soft drink. Others showed him in Peru’s red-and-white football shirt and another humorous image showed the popemobile refashioned as a three-wheeled motorcycle rickshaw, the principal mode of transport in much of the country.\nColombia’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti, posted on social media that the years spent in Peru “mean the new pope is once again a Latin American”.\nSome posts on social media jokingly claimed that the new pope was “more Latino than the entire cast of Emilia Pérez”, referencing the French film that sparked controversy over its portrayal of Mexico.\nPrevost first came to Peru in 1985, joining the Augustinian mission serving in the prelature in Chulucanas, near the border with Ecuador, until 1986. He returned in 1988, spending the following decade as head of the Augustinian seminary in Trujillo, the country’s third most populous city, also in the north, where he taught canon law and served as a judge on the regional ecclesiastical court.\nHe returned to the US in 1998 and was elected provincial of the Augustinian province of Chicago. He did not return to Peru until 2014 when Pope Francis appointed him as apostolic administrator of the diocese of Chiclayo. The following year, he was named bishop of the city. By 2023 he was promoted to archbishop, then he was made a cardinal in 2024.\nJaninna Sesa, who met Prevost when she worked for the Catholic charity Caritas, said he was the kind of person who would “put on boots and wade through the mud” to help those most in need – as he did in 2022, when torrential rains affected Chiclayo and nearby villages.\nHe also delivered food and blankets to remote Andean villages, driving a white pickup truck and sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor, she told the Associated Press.\nObservers say Prevost had a difficult relationship with the Catholic right in Peru, particularly Sodalitium, a far-right Peruvian lay Catholic sect, with a strong presence in the region where he worked. Just before his death, Pope Francis dissolved Sodalitium, after a 50-year history of sexual, psychological and physical abuse, and allegations of malfeasance and corruption.\nTiago Rogero, South America correspondent, contributed additional reporting",

    "text": "Former cabinet minister Ed Husic has promised to be “constructive” from the backbench despite taking aim at his deputy leader in an explosive interview on Sunday.\n“I want to play a constructive role,” he told Guardian Australia.\nBut he added that he would speak out on “important” issues, no longer constrained by cabinet solidarity, the principle that all ministers express support for their collective decisions.\nDumped from the cabinet on Thursday, Husic blamed deputy minister and right faction heavyweight, Richard Marles, whom he accused of being a “factional assassin”.\nOn Sunday morning he told the ABC’s Insiders program he believed his role in publicly criticising Israel was a factor in his ousting from cabinet.\nOn Sunday afternoon he said he would continue to speak out.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\n“I won’t speak on everything but I will speak on the important things, the things my community and the country cares about,” he said.\n“Robust debate occurred in some of the most successful long-term Labor governments. They thrived in that environment back then and we can right now.”\nHusic had accused Marles of being a “factional assassin”, and said the prime minister should have intervened to save him.\n“The difficult issue here is that we’ve had barefaced ambition and a deputy prime minister [who] wields a factional club to reshape the ministry,” he told the ABC’s Insiders.\n“I think people when they look at a deputy prime minister, they expect to see a statesman, not a factional assassin.”\nNeither Marles, nor the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, or others in the cabinet responded in public to Husic’s comments on Sunday.\nHusic and former attorney general Mark Dreyfus were dropped by the right faction.\nThe cabinet was oversubscribed with members of the New South Wales right faction, which forced Husic out, though he said he had volunteered rather than fight in a national ballot against his ministerial colleagues.\nIn Victoria, Dreyfus was moved to make way for younger and newer MPs to enter the ministry.\nAlbanese has a highly experienced and mature cabinet, with many of its members having been a part of the Gillard and Rudd ministries between 2010 and 2013, including Chris Bowen, Mark Butler, Penny Wong, Tanya Plibersek and Julie Collins.\nBefore the election, nine of the 23 cabinet ministers – or nine of the 22 after Bill Shorten resigned – had not previously been in the Rudd or Gillard ministries.\nDuring the election campaign, Albanese said some of his most senior ministers would remain in their portfolios – including Richard Marles, Jim Chalmers, Katy Gallagher, Penny Wong and Don Farrell.\nIt’s expected new ministers will receive calls on Sunday afternoon, with Albanese understood to be announcing the new ministry on Monday, ahead of their swearing in at government house on Tuesday.\nNSW MP Michelle Rowland, a former senior lawyer, has been tipped to become the attorney general, replacing Dreyfus. Industrial relations minister and solicitor, Murray Watt, has also been mentioned as a possibility for the role.\nWestern Australian MP Anne Aly may join the cabinet, with the western state a crucial part of Labor’s win in 2022, having lobbied for an extra spot.\nSenior ministers Mark Butler and Jason Clare may move to new portfolios, while Daniel Mulino, a new entrant to the ministry from Victoria and a Yale-educated economist, could fill the assistant treasurer role.\nThere has also been speculation that Plibersek will move from the environment ministry.",

    "title": "From snail slime to salmon sperm: the K-beauty boom hits UK high streets",
    "text": "Korean beauty products are moving from phone screens to UK high streets as social media drives sales of skincare with the help of eye-catching ingredients such as snail slime and salmon sperm.\nRetailers are looking to capitalise on the TikTok and Instagram trend for skincare and makeup ranges from South Korea – known as K-beauty – by opening physical stores and launching brands in a push to get consumers to pick up products that havegone viral online.\nWhile some of the ranges have been available on specialist beauty websites for some time, British shoppers are now getting the chance to try them out on their skin and assess their supposed wondrous effects.\nThe trend is another example of South Korea’s growing cultural prominence where food, film, TV and K-pop, with its international stars such as the boyband BTS, are becoming big business as companies expand into large consumer markets such as Britain.\nK-beauty’s positive reputation stems in part from Korea’s tradition of using natural substances in products, making them gentle on the skin, and its strict rules around labelling. The industry is also known for novel formulations and unexpected packaging (sometimes animal-shaped), although many shoppers discover brands such as Beauty of Joseon and Laneige through reviews by influencers.\nGeorgia Stafford, of the market research firm Mintel, says: “Social media is the driving force behind K-beauty’s popularity in the UK, where 34% of users have bought a beauty or grooming product after seeing it on social media, rising to 58% of Gen Z users.”\nA fifth (21%) of Gen Z consumers (aged 13-28) use K-beauty products, according to Mintel, compared with 8% overall. They are more likely to follow the complex 10-step skincare routines popular in South Korea, or try to get the “glass skin” look beloved by the beauty industry, where your face is drenched in moisture to give a dewy, luminous look.\nK-beauty products have previously had a “relatively limited audience”, according to Stafford, as they were unavailable on most high streets. However, online popularity could now translate to in-person purchases.\nShoppers can now buy products such as Cosrx’s skin essence containing snail mucin – slime to the uninitiated – at Superdrug and Boots. The latter store also sells Anua’s face serum with PDRN (polydeoxyribonucleotide), which contains DNA fragments extracted from salmon sperm and is claimed to hydrate the skin deeply.\nK-beauty products are “typically a fraction of the cost” compared with those from established premium brands, says Stafford. “Experimenting with new products and ingredients is therefore accessible to consumers. PDRN is a standout example. The ingredient promotes collagen production and its source is a real conversation starter!”\nBoots, Britain’s biggest beauty retailer, sold a Korean skincare product almost every 15 seconds between December and the end of February and in recent months has expanded the range of products it stocks.\nWhile consumers may be tightening their belts in other areas, spending on pharmacy, health and beauty has emerged as an outlier. Figures from Barclays show spend in this area was on average 10.2% higher during the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2024.\nThe Korean retailer Moida (which translates as “to gather” or “to collect”) launched its first UK store in west London’s Westfield shopping centre in December and opened its second in the capital this month.\nThe new shop, fitted out in pink and red and located near Leicester Square, is close to its fellow Korean beauty retailer PureSeoul, which now has eight outlets across the UK – including Birmingham, Manchester, Oxford and Cambridge – and is opening a further two this year.\nMeanwhile, the Korean beauty rival Skin Cupid has signed a 10-year lease for a UK outlet in central London close to Tottenham Court Road after the success of a nearby fortnight-long pop-up during the festive season.\nThe electronics giant LG is best known for its smart TVs and washer dryers, but the company’s first product, launched in 1947, was a moisturiser called Lucky Cream. LG hopes to ride the boom in interest in all things Korean through the expansion of its beauty arm, LG Household & Health Care (LG H&H). It launched its K-beauty brand Belif in the UK at the start of May, initially at online retailers and two London branches of retailer GlamTouch.\nLG is also looking at opening physical stores, says Steven Jeong, the managing director of LG H&H UK. “While our initial strategy focuses on online channels, we believe that in-person experiences are an essential part of the skincare journey, especially when it comes to texture and personalised consultation.” The company hopes to “establish an offline presence” from June, he says.\nMany consumers are also drawn to K-beauty as part of the wider rise in interest in Korea’s cultural exports, known as the Korean wave (hallyu). K-beauty is forecast to be a $18.3bn (£13.7bn) global business by 2030, according to a Straits Research report, growing at a rate of 9% each year from 2022 to the end of the decade.\n“I watch K-drama,” says Ike Lawson, 28, browsing the shelves of a central London PureSeoul store with two colleagues during her lunchbreak. “K-beauty products work for me, like the snail mucin serum. I went to Korea in 2023 to raid the skincare, but mostly for the food,” she says.\nLining the shelves of PureSeoul are stylish tubes and bottles of products, many boasting ingredients unfamiliar to the British market, ranging from mung beans and mugwort to propolis, which is extracted from bees.\nLawson’s colleague Georgia Spooner, 27, who has just bought a £22 sunscreen stick for her upcoming holiday, says she has noticed “more shops popping up”, after first discovering K-beauty on social media. “It’s more mainstream now.”\nThis Charing Cross Road branch of PureSeoul is something of a Korean hub with grocery shops and restaurants. Such locations appeal to retailers when choosing a space, says Matt Peters, a specialist in retail in the London office of the property company Savills.\n“Whilst these brands are looking to focus and showcase their product to a western audience, a lot of them will like to align with other Asian-focused businesses within a location,” Peters says.\nK-beauty retailers are among those filling in gaps on British high streets, according to Savills, with some signing 10-year leases, signalling their intention to commit to a location for a considerable period.\nPeters says: “These retailers see this as a long-term movement, this isn’t a flash in the pan. K-beauty has been in the UK for over five years now. It’s a sector that is increasing in terms of product sold over different retailers.”\nAs shoppers prioritise spending on wellness and cosmetics, property analysts expect K-beauty retailers will continue to eye up other areas outside London based on the location of their most loyal online shoppers.\nMoida is planning further expansion across the UK and intends to take a step outside London, taking its snail slime and other skincare novelties to Manchester in the summer.",

    "title": "UK care homes face ban on overseas recruitment under migration plans",
    "text": "Care homes will be prevented from recruiting staff from abroad as part of an overhaul of rules to drive down net migration, Yvette Cooper has said.\nIn a change that will concern employers in the sector, the home secretary said providers should instead seek to employ foreign staff who have already come to the country or extend existing visas.\nIt is part of a preview of wider plans to be announced by Cooper on Monday designed to reduce net migration to the UK.\nIt has also emerged that the government plans to assess for deportation any foreign criminals who commit any crimes in the UK.\nIn a series of interviews on Sunday, Cooper said the government would not set a figure for net migration but would target recruitment in lower-skilled sectors.\nSpeaking to Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, Cooper said: “We’re going to introduce new restrictions on lower-skilled workers, so new visa controls, because we think actually what we should be doing is concentrating on the higher-skilled migration and we should be concentrating on training in the UK.\n“New requirements to train here in the UK to make sure that the UK workforce benefits, and also we will be closing the care worker visa for overseas recruitment.”\nAsked by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg where care homes would recruit staff from, Cooper said companies should recruit from a pool of people who came as care workers in good faith but had been “exploited” by unscrupulous employers.\n“Care companies should be recruiting from those workers. They can also extend existing visas. They could recruit as well from people who are on other visas, who are already here. But we do think it’s time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad,” she said.\nWhile Cooper declined to set a specific target for net migration, she said ministers believed changes to certain visas could result in “up to 50,000 fewer lower-skilled visas” over the next year.\nAt present, foreign criminals are only reported to the Home Office if they receive a jail sentence and only those given a year behind bars are usually considered for deportation.\nUnder the new arrangements, the Home Office will be informed of all foreign nationals convicted of offences – not just those who receive prison sentences – and will be able to use wider removal powers on other crimes, including swifter action to remove people who have recently arrived in the country but already committed crimes.\nThe overhaul will make it easier to remove those who commit offences, including violence against women and girls, street crime and knife crime, before the threat they pose escalates.\nOn Monday, Cooper will present a government white paper – a document that sets out plans for future legislation – intended to notably curb net migration, as ministers try to respond to the local election success of Reform UK.\nNigel Farage’s party has focused much of its campaign work on the increase in net migration and successive governments’ failure to stop irregular crossings by asylum seekers across the Channel.\nThe Home Office will also introduce rules so that any foreign national placed on the sex offender register, regardless of sentence length, will be classed as having committed a “serious crime” with no right to asylum protections in the UK.\nAs part of the white paper, the government will update refusal policies and immigration rules to mirror these changes. This means if a person commits an offence while on a short-term visa, they will be refused if they make a fresh application.\nOther proposals are expected to include new rules so that companies that repeatedly fail to show efforts to recruit UK-based staff, rather than recruit from abroad, could lose their right to sponsor foreign workers. Sectors targeted by the government include engineering and IT.\nIt is expected that work visas will be strictly time-limited for most jobs that do not need graduate-level skills.\nForeign students who have studied for degrees in the UK will face tighter tules over their right to remain after finishing university. Overseas workers will be expected to have a better understanding of English, but reported suggestions of A-level equivalent have been denied.\nCooper is under significant pressure to further reduce net migration. As well as winning control of 10 councils on 1 May, Reform, which is promising an effective freeze on most migration, is topping most polls of national voter preference.\nWhile skilled visa numbers have already significantly reduced in the last few years, further hurdles to overseas recruitment could cause problems for industries such as care and hospitality.\nMinisters also plan to introduce a Labour Market Evidence Group, made up of officials from industry and skills bodies, as well as from the government and the Migration Advisory Council (MAC). It would, the Home Office said, “inform understanding of where sectors are overly reliant on overseas labour and reverse underinvestment in domestic skills”.",

Ultimately we would have had to have taken it to a national right ballot. The way it was managed was all very last minute,” he said.\n“I did not want to put my colleagues through a national ballot. Again, I did it in the interests of stability.”\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email\nHusic said Anthony Albanese called him on Saturday, two days after the decision was formally announced on Thursday.\nAsked repeatedly by host David Speers whether the prime minister had thanked Husic for his service, Husic only said there was a “very brief” discussion.\nHe said Albanese should have intervened to save him.\n“I’m not going to sit here with false modesty. Of course, when you hear him [Albanese] rattle off names of … people that would be retaining ministerial spots, I’m sure I wasn’t the only minister wanting to be in that list,” he said.\n“If he [Albanese] had exercised that authority, I don’t think anyone would have quibbled.”\nMark Dreyfus, who was also dumped from the Albanese cabinet in favour of the younger Victorian right faction MP Sam Rae, reportedly made phone calls to Marles and factional allies to try to secure his position.\nThe prime minister also didn’t intervene to save his position.\nHusic was the first Muslim to sit in the cabinet, and the first to be sworn in with a Qur’an.\nHe has been outspoken on the war in Gaza and was the first government member to accuse Israel of “collective punishment”.\n“You can’t celebrate diversity and then expect it to sit in the corner silent. You need to speak up, when you bring the different views to either a cabinet table or a caucus,” he said.\n“I certainly tried to help us navigate wretchedly difficult issues, such as Gaza, post the horrors of October 7.”\nOutside the ministry, Husic is likely to feel freer to express his views on the conflict and Labor policy related to it.\n“We’ve seen just in the past week or so the Israeli parliament say it wants to annex Gaza and effectively that is a form of ethnic cleansing,” he said on Insiders.\n“We’ve seen the starvation of its people through the failure to provide humanitarian assistance.\n“It [the Netanyahu government] should be held to account. Starvation is a war crime.”\nHusic said he would remain in the Labor party and hoped to return to the frontbench.\n“I have a contribution to make, I want to keep making it,” he said.",

    "text": "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has denied trespassing at a new United States federal immigration detention centre following his arrest and release.\nBaraka, who has been protesting the centre’s opening this week, denied his trespassing charge on Saturday, a day after he spent several hours in police custody.\nThe mayor, who is seeking the Democratic party’s nomination for governor, has gone head-to-head with the Trump administration over undocumented immigration, pushing back against the opening of the Delaney Hall Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 1,000-bed detention facility, arguing that it should not be allowed to open because of building permit issues.\nOfficials accused Baraka of trespassing and ignoring warnings to leave the Delaney Hall facility in Newark, New Jersey.\n“I’m shocked by all the lies that were told here,” he said, adding he had been invited there for a news conference.\n“No one else [was] arrested, I was invited in, then they arrested me on the sidewalk.”\nIn an interview Saturday with MSNBC, Baraka recounted being put in a cell, having his fingerprints taken and being the subject of a mug shot.\nHe said he would continue to try to gain entry to the detention facility. “We don’t know what’s going on in there,” said Baraka. He has a court date scheduled for Thursday.\nAlina Habba, interim US Attorney for New Jersey, said on the social media platform X that Baraka trespassed at the detention facility, which is run by private prison operator Geo Group.\nHabba said Baraka had “chosen to disregard the law”.\nTricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary for public affairs with the US Department of Homeland Security, said in an interview with CNN on Saturday that the investigation was ongoing and that more video from the scene would soon be released.\nShe also accused Baraka of playing “political games”.\nBaraka was taken into custody by the ICE agents in a scuffle at the facility.\nHe had joined several lawmakers at the detention centre for a demonstration on Friday.\nVideo of the incident showed that Baraka was arrested after returning to the public side of the gate to the facility.\nLocal elected officials swiftly condemned the federal agents’ actions, with the state’s governor, Phil Murphy, writing on X that he was “outraged by the unjust arrest”.",

    "title": "India and Pakistan agree Kashmir ceasefire but accuse each other of breaches",
    "text": "India and Pakistan have agreed to a US-mediated ceasefire with immediate effect, though its longevity was thrown into question after reports of cross-border shelling and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir just hours after it was announced.\nThe ceasefire – which was hoped to end days of escalating clashes between the two nuclear-armed countries – was first declared by the US president, Donald Trump, on Saturday afternoon, after 48 hours of diplomacy between India and Pakistan, apparently brokered by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and vice-president, JD Vance.\nTrump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\nThe ceasefire was later confirmed in a post on X by the Pakistani deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, who said the ceasefire would come in “with immediate effect”.\nThe Indian foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said the heads of military operations from both countries had spoken on Saturday afternoon.\n“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea. Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.” The top military officials would speak again on 12 May, Misri added.\nHowever, the agreement was thrown into question after cross-border shelling restarted between the Indian and Pakistan armies on Saturday night. Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir, was also rocked by heavy explosions from projectiles that soared across the border.\nOn Saturday night, Misri said India’s armed forces had been given instructions to “deal strongly” with the violations.\nAn Indian government source told AFP that Pakistan had violated the ceasefire. A senior Pakistani security source said it was India that had started the ceasefire violations.\nThe Pakistani foreign ministry said in the early hours of Sunday that it “remains committed to faithful implementation” of the ceasefire it has agreed to with India.\nAccusing India of committing its own violations, the Pakistani foreign ministry said its forces were “handling the situation with responsibility and restraint”. It continued: “We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. The troops on ground should also exercise restraint.”\nRubio said the ceasefire agreement had come after extensive negotiations by him and Vance with the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, and other top officials.\n“I am pleased to announce the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio said on X.\n“We commend prime ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,” he added.\nNews of the ceasefire was greeted with celebrations across India and Pakistan, particularly in Kashmir, the disputed region divided between the two countries that had been at the forefront of hostilities, with dozens killed in shelling over the border – known as the Line of Control (LoC) – in the past week.\nIn Uri, near the border in Indian-administered Kashmir, one of the worst-hit towns in the recent cross-border violence, Tanveer Chalko, 30, described scenes of jubilation.\n“When news of the ceasefire broke, displaced families in camps began dancing with joy,” he said. “This is a great step towards peace and the welfare of the people. As a resident of a frontier area, I cannot put into words what this announcement means for us. Now everyone is preparing to return home.”\nBut Lal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, a border town in Indian-administered Kashmir where many were killed and injured in this week’s violence along the LoC, said the news of the ceasefire was bittersweet. His home was destroyed in cross-border shelling and two of his relatives were killed.\n“We’ve been here before – temporary ceasefires brokered by global powers. But until India and Pakistan seriously settle their disputes, we must brace for even greater conflicts,” he said.\nHowever, those who gathered in the streets to celebrate were then driven indoors as explosions began to boom out over parts of Indian-Kashmir on Saturday night.\nHistorically, the US has played an important role as a mediator between India and Pakistan when hostilities have flared up. The Trump administration’s proactive role in brokering peace was, however, a notable reversal of Vance’s position 48 hours earlier, when he said the US would not intervene in the India-Pakistan conflict as it was “none of our business”.\nThe ceasefire appeared to give both sides the opportunity to walk away claiming victory. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\nIn Pakistan it was met with a chorus of approval. “Congratulations to the civil and military leadership for emerging out of the war with dignity, professionalism and national resolve unequivocally intact,” said the Pakistani senator Sherry Rehman.\nThe ceasefire came after India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border missile strikes against significant military targets on Saturday, with many fearful it would escalate into all-out war. India and Pakistan have fought four wars, most recently in 1999.\nThe fighting this week was first inflamed on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were in response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which it blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists.\nThe situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks. India claimed to have intercepted more than 400 drones targeting cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday. In retaliation, India said it had launched four drone strikes on Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure.\nBy Saturday morning, India had accused Pakistan of launching strikes on dozens of airbases and military headquarters across north India, using long-range weapons, drones and fighter aircraft. The accusations came a few hours after Pakistan said India had fired six surface-to-air missiles targeting three of Pakistan’s most important military bases early on Saturday morning. Both accused the other of firing cross-border missiles first.\nAdditional reporting by Agence France-Presse",

    "text": "The interim government in Bangladesh has banned all activities of the former ruling Awami League party headed by former influential prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted last year in a mass uprising.\nAsif Nazrul, the country’s law affairs adviser, said on Saturday the interim cabinet headed by the Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus decided to ban the party’s activities online and elsewhere under the country’s Anti-Terrorism Act. The ban would stay in place until a special tribunal completes a trial of the party and its leaders over the deaths of hundreds of students and other protesters during an anti-government uprising in July and August last year.\n“This decision is aimed at ensuring national security and sovereignty, protection of activists of the July movement, and plaintiffs and witnesses involved in the tribunal proceedings,” Nazrul told reporters after a special cabinet meeting.\nNazrul said the meeting on Saturday also expanded scope for trying any political parties involving charges of killing during the anti-Hasina protest being handled by the international crimes tribunal.\nHe said a government notification regarding the ban would be published soon with details.\nHasina and many of her senior party colleagues have been accused of murder in many cases after her ouster last year. She has been in exile in India since 5 August as her official residence was stormed by protesters soon after she left the country.\nThe UNs human rights office said in a report in February that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during three weeks of anti-Hasina protest.\nSaturday night’s dramatic decision came after thousands of protesters, including supporters of a newly formed political party by students, took to the streets in Dhaka and issued an ultimatum to ban the Awami League party by Saturday night. The members of the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party also prominently took part in the protest.\nThere was no immediate reaction from Hasina or her party, but the chief of the Jatiya Nagorik or National Citizen party, Nahid Islam, who is also a student leader, applauded the Yunus-led government for its decision.\nThe student-led uprising ended Hasina’s 15 years of rule, and three days after her fall Yunus took office as interim leader.",

    "title": "How backchannels and US mediators pulled rivals back from the brink",
    "text": "How backchannels and US mediators pulled India and Pakistan back from the brink\n7 hours ago\nSoutik Biswas and Vikas Pandey\nBBC News\nReporting from Delhi\nIn a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility.\nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir - triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases.\nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India–Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview.\nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang.\nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons.\nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.",

    "text": "Thousands of Israelis rallied in central Tel Aviv, calling on the government to end the war on Gaza and secure the immediate release of Israeli captives held in the besieged Palestinian enclave.\nThe Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that in Tel Aviv, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli campaign group, held its weekly rally Saturday in “Hostages Square”, while another demonstration by families of captives is taking place outside the Israeli military headquarters.\nA separate antigovernment protest also occurred at Habima Square in Tel Aviv.\nThe Times of Israel reported that Shai Mozes, whose parents were held captive and released in separate exchange deals, told the crowd at the protest in Habima Square that Israel’s “real enemy is not Hamas, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is destroying Israel as a Jewish and democratic state”.\nAl Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said that “family members of Israeli captives still held in Gaza say that Netanyahu is still prolonging the war for personal and political gain, and that he’s the one who’s not willing to compromise when it comes to any sort of cease fire deal”.\n“There are still 59 captives held in Gaza, 35 of whom Israeli officials say are confirmed dead, and 21 that are presumed alive, and three whose fate is still unknown”, she said.\n“Israeli officials say that they are going to be expanding their operations in Gaza and not heading toward any sort of ceasefire deal just yet, saying that the best way to bring about the release of those captives is through military means, something that the family members of captives and the larger portion of Israeli society do not agree with” she said.\nAfter Netanyahu announced an expanded offensive in the Gaza Strip on Monday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum criticised the move in a statement, saying the plan is “sacrificing” those still held in the Palestinian territory.\nHaaretz also reported that protests were planned in other cities, including Jerusalem, Haifa, and Beersheba, as well as at dozens of other sites and intersections across Israel.\nHamas releases video of two Israeli captives alive in Gaza\nHamas’s armed wing released a video on Saturday showing two Israeli captives alive in the Gaza Strip, with one of the two men calling to end the 19-month-long war.\nIsraeli media identified the pair in the undated video as Elkana Bohbot and Yosef Haim Ohana.\nThe three-minute video released by Hamas’s Qassam Brigades shows one of the captives, identified by media as 36-year-old Bohbot, visibly weak and lying on the floor wrapped in a blanket.\nOhana, 24, speaks in Hebrew in the video, urging the Israeli government to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of all remaining captives.\nBohbot and Ohana were both abducted by Palestinian fighters from the site of a music festival during Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on October 7 2023.",

The senator said in the video they both had “such passion” for Australia, the party and the Coalition.\n“As you know Angus, I’ve been a fighter all my life, and I think we’re in a really good position to come back from this and come back strong … You’ve got incredible experience behind you and I’ve had the pleasure of having you as a mentor,” Nampijinpa Price said.\n“We have such passion for this country, for our party and for the Coalition as a whole.”\nThe ballot for the next leader and deputy leader will take place on Tuesday, the same day the new Albanese ministry will be sworn in.\nOn Friday, the deputy leader, Sussan Ley, formally announced her run for the leadership, but it was unclear who would run with her for deputy.\nAfter a controversial defection, which spurred anger and “disappointment” within the National party, Price’s leadership tilt has also sparked some concern within the Liberal ranks.\nOn Friday, before the announcement, Liberal sources told Guardian Australia Nampijinpa Price was “not the answer” for the future of the party.\nOn Sunday, Liberal senator Dave Sharma, a moderate, was asked on Sky News whether it was too soon for Nampijinpa Price to be putting her hand up for the deputy leadership.\n“She’s perfectly entitled to put her hand up … people will have different views about that issue though, I think,” he said.\nAsked whether either leadership candidate had been offering shadow cabinet roles in return for support, Sharma said he would be “appalled” if there was horse-trading, but didn’t believe that had taken place.\n“I think that [if] any prospective leadership candidate was going around trading portfolios for support, [they’re] taking the completely wrong approach,” he said.\nLey, also a moderate, released her own statement on Friday, which said the party needed to “build a new economic narrative”.\n“We need new policy offerings to show everyday Australians that we have a plan to help them and their families get ahead,” she said.\n“We need to rebuild trust with all sections of Australian society, and my election as leader of the Liberal Party would send a very strong signal that we understand that things must be done differently.”",

    "text": "The Trump administration is invoking the “state secrets privilege ” in an apparent attempt to avoid answering a judge’s questions about its erroneous deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García to El Salvador.\nUS district judge Paula Xinis disclosed the government’s position in a two-page order on Wednesday. She set a Monday deadline for attorneys to file briefs on the issue and how it could affect Ábrego García’s case. Xinis also scheduled a 16 May hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland, to address the matter.\nThe Republican administration previously invoked the same legal authority to cut off a judge’s inquiry into whether it defied an order to turn around planes deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.\nÁbrego García, 29, has been imprisoned in his native El Salvador for nearly two months. His mistaken deportation has become a flash point for Donald Trump’s immigration policies and his increasing friction with the US courts.\nTrump has said he could call El Salvador’s president and have Ábrego García, who was living in Maryland, returned to the United States. Instead, Trump has doubled down on his claims that Ábrego García is a member of the MS-13 gang.\nPolice in Maryland had identified Ábrego García as an MS-13 gang member in 2019 based off his tattoos, Chicago Bulls hoodie and the word of a criminal informant. But Ábrego García was never charged. His lawyers say the informant claimed Ábrego García was in an MS-13 chapter in New York, where Ábrego García has never lived.\nThe administration has balked at telling Xinis what, if anything, it has done to facilitate Ábrego García’s return to the US. The judge ruled that his lawyers can question several Trump administration officials under oath about the government’s response to her orders.\nIn a court filing on Wednesday, his lawyers said they already have conducted depositions of three officials and are “still in the dark” about the government’s efforts to free Ábrego García. They are asking for permission to depose more officials, possibly including one from the White House.",

    "title": "Clergy molestation survivors concerned and insulted by election of Pope Leo XIV",
    "text": "Groups supporting clergy-molestation survivors say they are gravely concerned and insulted by the election of Pope Leo XIV after he overcame questions about his handling of clerical sexual abuse cases earlier in his career to become the Roman Catholic church’s first-ever US-born leader.\nBefore Robert Prevost’s ascent to the papacy at age 69, he was leading a chapter of the Augustinian religious order in his home town of Chicago when allegations surfaced that a priest and Catholic high school principal under his jurisdiction had molested at least one student as well as kept child-abuse imagery.\nPrevost reportedly allowed that cleric to continue in his role despite the allegations, though the Augustinian order later paid a multimillion-dollar settlement to the abuse survivor and in December booted the priest from the order.\nMeanwhile, Prevost also did not impede another priest – whose ministry had been restricted in the wake of allegations that he abused minors – from living at an Augustinian residence that was near a Catholic elementary school. And, while serving as a bishop in Peru, Prevost heard from three women who accused two priests there of sexually abusing them as minors and have since claimed there is no evidence that much was done to investigate the cleric.\nThat history prompted the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (Snap) to file a complaint against Prevost in March under church legislation implemented by the late Pope Francis that provided potential disciplinary measures against bishops who were found to have turned a blind eye to abuse of both children and adults considered vulnerable.\nThe complaint did not prevent Leo from being elected on Thursday after a short conclave at the Vatican, which prompted Snap to quickly issue a statement expressing “grave concern about his record managing abuse cases”.\n“You can end the abuse crisis,” Snap’s statement said of Leo, who has not been accused of abuse himself and had previously headed the Vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops from around the world. “The only question is: will you?”\nIn a separate statement, the Survivors of Childhood Sex Abuse (SCSA) said Leo’s election was “an insult” given that he was produced by the same Catholic hierarchy that has failed to grapple with the scale and systemic nature of the global church’s decades-old clergy molestation scandal.\n“The Catholic hierarchy has not merely mishandled abuse allegations – it industrialized the process,” the SCSA’s statement said. “Pope Leo XIV … was in the rooms for all of it.”\nBoth organizations urged Leo to implement a true zero-tolerance policy with respect to taking action against clergy abuse claims as well as to provide victims of the scandal with reparations from church assets, among other demands.\nMitchell Garabedian, the Boston attorney who represented abuse survivors amid the clergy molestation scandal depicted in the Oscar-winning movie Spotlight, added: “The Catholic church has to understand that the safety of innocent children cannot be sacrificed for an outdated and inexcusable need to protect the reputation of the Catholic church.”\nThe Vatican’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the statements from Snap and SCSA. It has generally maintained that Prevost is free of any wrongdoing or followed canonical norms in the clergy abuse cases he has confronted.\nSome of the scrutiny surrounding Prevost’s handling of those cases dates back to his 11-year tenure leading the Augustinian order’s midwest chapter in Chicago beginning in 1999. During that time, claims reportedly surged that the principal of Providence Catholic high school in New Lenox, Illinois, which was part of Prevost’s territory, had molested a student and possessed images of child abuse on his phone.\nPrevost – who was also the Augustinians’ worldwide leader for 12 years beginning in 2001 – left the principal, an Augustinian priest named Richard McGrath, in his post, a decision he has not explained, as the Chicago Sun-Times has previously reported.\nMcGrath retired in 2017 after being faced with an investigation into the claims against him.\nThe abused student, Robert Krankvich, then sued in 2018. And in late 2023 the church agreed to pay him $2m – before Krankvich died in April at age 43.\n“Money doesn’t bring happiness,” Krankvich’s father, also named Robert, said to the Sun-Times. “It gave him no closure.”\nDuring Krankvich’s lawsuit, McGrath declined to answer whether or not he possessed child abuse images, invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination, the Sun-Times reported. Yet McGrath denied molesting Krankvich and was kept off a list of alleged Augustinian abusers published in 2024, though he resigned in light of the claims against him.\nNonetheless, in a statement issued on Tuesday, the Augustinians confirmed McGrath had been expelled from their order, according to New Lenox’s Patch news website.\nThe Augustinians reportedly did not disclose the factors behind McGrath’s dismissal, which occurred in December but was first reported on the eve of the start of the two-day conclave that vaulted Prevost to the papacy.\nSeparately, in 2000 and still early in Prevost’s stint as the midwestern US Augustinian chapter, the order stationed a member priest named James Ray in its St John Stone Friary in Chicago. The friary was adjacent to an elementary school, and since 1991, Ray was restricted from working around children because of accusations that he had molested minors. Survivors groups say those moves are not indicative of an organization doing everything it can to protect children. The Vatican has reportedly countered that Prevost was not the one who authorized Ray’s living arrangements at the friary.\nPrevost subsequently spent eight years as the bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, beginning in 2015. According to a statement that they issued, three women told Prevost directly that they had allegedly been abused as minors by local priests named Eleuterio Vásquez González and Ricardo Yesquén.\nBut the women said they had no evidence any meaningful investigation into their claims ensued, and at one point they published several images showing Vásquez publicly celebrating mass on important occasions such as Easter despite purported assurances to them that he was suspended from such ministry, as the National Catholic Reporter noted in reporting on a case rife with conflicting claims.\nChiclayo’s diocese reportedly said the Vatican agency which investigates clerical sexual abuse cases found insufficient evidence to substantiate the accusers’ allegations – and that local law enforcement authorities reached a similar conclusion, in part citing the lapse of an applicable statute of limitations.\nOne of the accusers, Ana María Quispe, lamented in Spanish to the Peruvian television news program Cuarto Poder: “They have always told us the church is our mother – but a mother protects.”\nFor its part, Chiclayo’s diocese reportedly said “it is not true” that Prevost and the church “turned its back on the alleged victims”. The diocese reportedly said the accusers remained free to pursue complaints in civil court and have a standing offer of church-provided “psychological help if they required it”.\nA statement from BishopAccountability.org contended that Prevost never published a list of accused abusers under his supervision, unlike many Catholic dioceses and religious orders which did as an offering of conciliation over the scourge of clergy molestation within the worldwide church.",

    "title": "Operation to recover Mike Lynch’s superyacht suspended after diver dies",
    "text": "Recovery operations to raise the late tech tycoon Mike Lynch’s superyacht Bayesian from the seabed off Sicily have been suspended after a diver died during underwater work.\nRob Cornelis Maria Huijben, a 39-year-old Dutch diver, died on Friday while doing preparation work to cut the ship’s mainmast. He was employed by the maritime company Hebo, whose barge arrived last week in Porticello, a fishing port near Palermo. The luxury vessel was anchored just off Porticello when it was struck shortly before dawn by a violent storm on 19 August 2024. It sank within seconds, killing seven people, including Lynch and his daughter Hannah.\nPolice said the cause of the diver’s death was unknown and an investigation was launched.\n“This pause in activity is necessary for the investigations to be completed and to allow all salvage and associated teams to mourn the tragic loss of a highly respected salvage diver during yesterday’s underwater work,” read a statement from the British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which will oversee a consortium of salvage specialists undertaking the project.\nA preliminary examination of the diver’s body revealed no visible injuries or burns. Investigators believe he may have suffered a medical problem while submerged.\nAn alternative line of inquiry is that after divers used a blowtorch to cut the vessel’s boom, Huijben was struck by dislodged debris – possibly a piece of metal. Footage captured by underwater cameras cut off shortly before the incident.\nMarcus Cave, head of naval architecture and a director of TMC Marine, said Friday’s tragedy “has been felt by all involved in this project, and the priority right now is the family of this expert, specialist diver, who was well liked and indeed loved by all involved in the project. This pause in operations will enable thorough investigations to be completed into this tragic accident. It will also help us to mourn and regroup.\n“Our thoughts are with everyone affected. Salvage operations at sea always carry an element of risk,” he added. “The salvage team is providing full cooperation to the authorities in their investigations.”\nA further project update will be issued after the weekend.\nInvestigators hope the yacht will yield vital clues: whether a series of human errors led to the sinking, as initially suspected, or if other factors were at play. Once it is ashore, an examination will determine if one of the hatches remained open and whether the keel was improperly raised.\nLynch, who in June last year was cleared of fraud charges in the US relating to the sale of his company, Autonomy, to Hewlett-Packard in 2011, was enjoying a lavish voyage around Sicily to celebrate his acquittal alongside 18-year-old Hannah and his wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian.\nAmong those on board were Lynch’s attorney from Clifford Chance, Chris Morvillo, his wife, the jewellery designer Neda Morvillo, Morgan Stanley International’s chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, a former psychotherapist. All four died in the incident. The yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, was the seventh person who died.\nFifteen people survived, including Bacares.\nThe wreck sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello, which is under surveillance by Italian authorities.\nInsurers estimate the salvage will cost about $30m (£23m), a bill the Bayesian’s underwriters will pick up.",

    "title": "‘The whole country is proud’: Chinese snooker fans hail Zhao Xintong triumph",
    "text": "Chain smoking under the fluorescent lights of a cavernous billiards hall in Beijing, Brother Yuan can’t stop smiling. The previous day, along with 150 million other people across China, he had been at home watching the snooker world championships final. Now he’s with his fellow cue-heads, celebrating the win of China’s first snooker world champion, Zhao Xintong.\n“He’s a great role model for young people in China,” Yuan, 55, says of the generation Z upstart who on Monday claimed snooker’s top prize. “He’s bringing the excitement back.”\nIt’s a far cry from the 1980s when Yuan was a young player in Beijing with dreams of going professional. The industry wasn’t well developed and the money wasn’t there. He remembers vividly the 1987 Kent Cup, a snooker tournament held in Beijing.\n“All seven of the world’s top-ranked players came. Willie Thorne, Jimmy White, Steve Davis … At that time, snooker was only played in Zhongshan Park in Beijing. No other places in the city had it, and most people didn’t even know how to play,” Yuan says. “I recall two Chinese players participated, but they clearly had very little idea how to play snooker. It was actually quite funny to watch.”\nNowadays, Chinese snooker is no laughing matter. Zhao’s victory on Monday completed his comeback from a 20-month suspension for involvement in a match-fixing ring that has been described as the biggest scandal in snooker’s history. Snooker’s governing body charged 10 Chinese players with match-fixing offences in January 2023 and handed out bans ranging from 20 months to a lifetime. Zhao did not directly throw a match but he accepted charges of being party to another player fixing two games and betting on matches himself.\nHis display of genuine remorse since the scandal was exposed and his rise to the top from being relegated to the amateur tour as part of his punishment has won him legions of fans in China and beyond.\n“Honestly, at first I didn’t think he’d beat [Mark Williams],” says a snooker fan surnamed Xu who works at KO Snooker Bar in Beijing, referring to the three-time world champion who was Zhao’s opponent in the final. “That shows he’s really put in the work. He’s impressive.”\nFans online have been similarly impressed. The hashtag about Zhao’s win was viewed more than 180m times on Weibo.\nArriving at Shenzhen Bao’an airport on Thursday, a slightly bewildered Zhao was greeted by hordes of fans thrusting flowers into his arms and reporters thrusting microphones. “Thanks again everyone for your support. I’ll start again and take it slow, and continue to achieve better results in snooker,” Zhao said.\nZhao hails from Shenzhen, a city on the border with Hong Kong that is known for having the most developed snooker culture in China, thanks in part to its proximity to the former British colony. In the 1990s, as people flocked to the city during the era of reform and opening up in which China underwent rapid economic development, snooker halls “sprang up like mushrooms after rain”, according to a Shenzhen state media article published this week to celebrate Zhao’s win.\nDing Juhui, China’s most successful snooker player before Zhao came on to the scene, moved to Shenzhen at a young age to train owing to the city’s better snooker opportunities, the article said.\nSince the 1990s, snooker has boomed in popularity across the country, and Zhao’s victory is expected to push it even higher. An estimated 50 million people play the sport and China has 300,000 snooker halls, up from 34,000 in 2005. Chinese eight-ball, a variant on pool, is even more popular.\nSun Baochen opened KO Snooker Bar in Beijing’s upmarket Sanlitun district in February. He’s hoping to capitalise on any new Zhao-led boom. Already he spends up to 16 hours a day at the club, which is open around the clock. Business has been “extremely busy”, he says, although on a Tuesday evening there are only about a dozen customers. Zhao’s victory will “definitely” boost the footfall, Sun says. “My whole WeChat Moments feed was talking about it. People were going crazy. It’s something the whole country is proud of.”\nYuan beams: “It’s going to create a huge wave of interest. And there are a lot of people in China.”\nAdditional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian Yang",

    "title": "Trump’s aid cuts blamed as food rations stopped for a million refugees in Uganda",
    "text": "Food rations for a million people in Uganda have been cut off completely this week amid a funding crisis at the United Nations World Food Programme, raising fears that refugees will now be pushed back into countries at war.\nThe WFP in Uganda warned two weeks ago that $50m (£37m) was urgently needed to help refugees and asylum seekers fleeing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Sudan.\nUganda hosts Africa’s largest refugee population of 1.8 million, with 60,000 new arrivals in the last three months. Malnutrition rates had reached a crisis point, said the UN agency.\n“Due to severe funding shortages, @WFP_Uganda has cut 1 million refugees entirely off from food assistance,” the agency announced via social media.\n“Malnutrition has reached critical levels (15% +) in refugee reception centres, and general food rations have been cut by up to 80%,” it said.\nIn March, the WFP slashed food relief, introducing rationing for new arrivals to the east African country.\nHillary Onek, Uganda’s minister for refugees, said it was a direct result of the radical aid cuts by the US and European countries.\nDonald Trump’s freeze on US aid spending in January and the UK’s cut in aid spending the following month from 0.58% of gross national income to 0.3% have badly hit Uganda’s ability to look after refugees.\n“The problem is beyond and outside our control. The global funding to support refugees has dwindled. The money given to the World Food Programme to buy food was cut off. The refugees are going to suffer the consequences,” Onek said.\n“Aid can’t be depended on any more. Trump came and radically cut off funds to support refugee programmes. Other countries who have been contributing, most of them are not honouring their small contributions. WFP and UNHCR are in a total crisis because of lack of funding,” he said.\nJust 46% of the $858m required in the multi-agency Uganda Country Refugee Response Plan was funded in 2024.\n“It’s impossible for us now to shoulder the burden of refugee challenge alone. I see there is going to be impending confusion, increased violence and war,” said Onek.\n“These people [refugees] will be looking for something to survive. They want to be alive. They will go into people’s cassava gardens, uproot them and that is war and confusion. We don’t know how we shall overcome that impending confusion,” he said.\nUNHCR launched an appeal for $44m last month to support 55,000 new Congolese refugees and an additional 25,000 expected to arrive over the next six months.\n“This rapid influx has placed considerable pressure on basic social services, including education, food, shelter, health and nutrition services, and WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene] infrastructure,” the UNHCR said.\n“These conditions have strained the already limited resources, further worsened by the surge in new arrivals, lengthy processing times and the strain on transportation services for refugees.”\nSimon Okello, a South Sudanese refugee in Bidi Bidi refugee camp, one of Africa’s largest, said the cuts would cause starvation and malnutrition.\n“We are totally messed up. This has complicated our lives totally,” he said. “We have been surviving on food rations and coupons. How are we going to get food to eat now? People will starve and die.”\n“Without food now, people might be forced to go back to their home countries where we fled from or engage in illegal activities to get something to eat,” he said.\nActivists fear Uganda may now begin forced repatriations, something Onek said Uganda’s cabinet would shortly be discussing.\n“The other option available is that those refugees whose countries are peaceful, we should change our policies and make sure we force them to go back to their homes and leave us alone,” said Onek. “I will have to discuss it with my cabinet colleagues and then we see what direction to take.”\nDismas Nkunda, director of Atrocities Watch Africa, said: “We saw this coming. It began with the self-reliance programme where UN bodies started to go slow on the provision of humanitarian assistance.\n“Matters were not helped by the coming of Trump as president and his cuts in funding for the UN.\n“My fear is that host countries such as Uganda may be forced to become radical and reverse their otherwise good policies in hosting refugees,” he said.",

    "title": "Trump claims ‘total reset’ in US-China trade relations after tariff talks in Geneva",
    "text": "Donald Trump has hailed a “total reset” in US-China trade relations after the first day of talks between top American and Chinese officials in Geneva aimed at defusing a trade war sparked by his tariff rollout.\nThe US president praised the “very good” discussions and deemed them “a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner”.\n“We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business,” he posted on his Truth Social platform early on Sunday, adding: “GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!” He did not elaborate on the progress.\nEarlier, top US and Chinese officials wrapped up the first day of talks in the Swiss city aimed at de-escalating tensions that threaten to hammer the global economy. Negotiations were expected to continue on Sunday, a source close to the discussions said.\nChina’s vice-premier, He Lifeng, met for about eight hours with US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, in their first face-to-face meeting since the world’s two largest economies heaped tariffs well above 100% on each other’s goods.\nTrump’s tariffs imposed on China this year currently total 145%, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching 245%. China has slapped retaliatory levies of 125% on US goods, cementing what appears to be a near trade embargo between the two countries\nNeither side made any statements afterwards about the substance of the discussions nor signalled any specific progress towards reducing the crushing tariffs as meetings at the residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the UN concluded about 8pm local time (1800 GMT).\nBessent, Greer and He were meeting in Geneva after weeks of growing tensions prompted by Trump’s tariff blitz starting in February and retaliation from Beijing that has brought nearly $600bn in annual bilateral trade to a virtual standstill. The trade dispute, combined with Trump’s decision last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stoked fears of a sharp global downturn.\nThe location of the talks in the Swiss diplomatic hub was never made public. However, witnesses saw both delegations returning after a lunch break to the gated UN ambassador’s villa in Cologny.\nEarlier, US officials including Bessent and Greer smiled as they left their hotel on the way to the talks. Bessent declined to speak to reporters. At the same time, Mercedes vans with tinted windows were seen leaving a hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying.\nWashington is seeking to reduce its $295bn goods trade deficit with Beijing and persuade China to renounce what the US says is a mercantilist economic model and contribute more to global consumption. Beijing has pushed back against what it sees as external interference and wants Washington to lower tariffs and clarify what it wants China to buy more of.\nChina’s official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Saturday that the US’s “reckless abuse of tariffs” had destabilised the global economic order, but added that the negotiations represented “a positive and necessary step to resolve disagreements and avert further escalation”.\nEconomic analysts have low expectations of a breakthrough. Trump said on Friday that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods “seems right”, suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145% levies he has imposed on Chinese imports.\nHe has suggested the discussions were initiated by China. Beijing said the US requested the discussions and that China’s policy of opposing US tariffs had not changed.\nThe US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told Fox News on Friday: “The president would like to work it out with China. He would like to de-escalate the situation.”\nTrump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, clarified that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally and that China would need to make concessions.\nThe Swiss economy minister, Guy Parmelin, met both parties in Geneva on Friday and said the fact the talks were taking place was already a success.\n“If a road map can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions,” he told reporters on Friday, saying talks could continue into Sunday or even Monday.",

    "title": "Resistance and extractivism: Inside Carrara, Italy’s home of white marble",
    "text": "Carrara, Italy - At dawn, the jagged peaks of the Apuan Alps can be seen rising steeply above the Tyrrhenian Sea, their sharp silhouettes mirrored in the still water below. Shaped over millennia by wind and rain - and in recent centuries by mining - these mountains have a deeply scarred appearance.\nFor more than 2,000 years, marble has been extracted from these hills.\nBut today, the damage this has caused is more visible than ever. Aquifers polluted by industrial products used for the mining process, a near-constant procession of heavy trucks pumping fumes into the air and a high number of workplace accidents in the quarries - the last fatal accident happened on April 28 - are the daily reality of a territory in flux, a place where natural beauty and industrial transformation collide.\nCarrara, a small town nestled at the foot of the Apuan Alps in northwestern Tuscany, is one of the world’s most important white marble extraction districts, with more than 100 quarries on its doorstep.\nMarble has been quarried in this area since Roman times, when it became the stone of the empire. Used for decoration, construction and sculpture, it was a symbol of prestige and high status.\nLater, it was used by the Catholic Church in much the same way - to adorn important palaces and cathedrals and to create religious sculptures. During the Renaissance, Carrara marble gained fame through sculptures by artists like Michelangelo, Donatello, Bernini and others.\nOver the past two centuries, however, the process has changed dramatically - shifting from artisanal methods to industrial extraction.\nToday, marble still carries the aura of global luxury. It’s celebrated in architecture magazines, interior design trends, and films like The Brutalist. But beneath the polished surface lies a far more complex story.\nOver the past 30 years, more marble has been extracted than during the previous two millennia. From the port of Marina di Carrara, a few kilometres from the quarries, it is shipped across the globe. According to municipal data, Carrara’s marble industry produces between 4 million and 5 million tonnes of marble each year, generating 130 million euros ($148m) in profits, driven largely by exports: Raw blocks go mainly to China (51 percent), while carved marble items head mostly to the United States, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\nCarrara has changed\nThe historical centre of Carrara is a maze of narrow, medieval streets lined with pastel-coloured facades, artisan workshops and quiet courtyards.\nThe Carrione stream, which flows down from the Apuan Alps, cuts through the downtown area where 14th- to 18th-century stone houses with shuttered windows stand alongside ornate church portals and marble sculptures - carved from stone extracted just a few kilometres away in the mountains that are clearly visible from the city.\nSince the 2012 opening of the Strada dei Marmi - a 119-million euro ($135m) bypass stretching 6km (4 miles) between the quarries and the local industrial area, diverting heavy traffic away from the town - marble trucks no longer barrel through the town centre. At one point, as many as 600 trucks each day brought dust, noise and diesel fumes into town. Today, the air is cleaner, the streets are calmer.\nBut the silence also reflects a broader decline. Carrara’s population has fallen below 60,000 - its lowest since World War II - and more than 200 small businesses have shut down in the past 10 years. As young people have left in search of work elsewhere and automation has replaced many jobs in the quarries, the bakeries, butchers, fishmongers - everyday life in the town - are disappearing.\nThe quarries are also changing. Today, less than 1 percent of the marble extracted in Carrara is used for sculpture - a stark departure from the region’s traditional legacy. That included the romanticised myth around the men who worked in the quarries. For centuries, men extracted marble from the rugged Apuan Alps with limited means, facing immense risks and frequent accidents. They were seen by Italians as conquering the mountains through grit and sheer determination and were considered a symbol of strength and sacrifice.\nThe marble mined was used primarily for the construction and decoration of temples, public monuments, churches, palaces and fine sculpture, as well as locally for furnishing homes. Only scraps and lower-grade stone were diverted for use as lime or aggregate for construction.\nThese days, much of the marble mined here is turned into calcium carbonate, a key ingredient used to make everyday products including toothpaste, paper and paint. Since the 1980s, the calcium carbonate market has made it possible to transform waste - marble blocks not suitable for other uses - into profit by grinding it into marble powder for use in various industrial goods.\nMeanwhile, large marble blocks are shipped abroad, where cheaper labour is used to produce tiles, furniture and luxury finishes.\nCarrara, once the beating heart of marble craftsmanship, therefore, has lost nearly all of its artisanal industry.\n“Carrara has changed,” says Matteo Procuranti, an artist and activist whose father was once a quarry director.\n“Back in the day, we had three cinemas and two theatres,” recalls the former quarry worker. “Now it’s all closed. People leave. Carrara has become a dormitory beneath the quarries.”\nMatteo’s father, like many others, switched from extracting marble blocks to working for Omya, a multinational company that, starting in the 1980s, began grinding marble waste into calcium carbonate. Eventually, he was laid off during a round of job cuts.\nThat experience triggered a deep awakening for Matteo, gradually changing his life and perspective. “It wasn’t just about the quarries,” he says. “Over time, I realised the problem was much bigger - it had to do with the entire economic and production model.”\nHe believes the region has been overtaken by what he calls “extractivism”, a system driven by profits. “It consumes resources, drains communities, and concentrates power and wealth elsewhere,” he says.\n“It has become a political struggle [for us], a collective one, rooted in our territory but looking far beyond it.”\nResisting ‘extractivism’ through art\nMatteo is an actor and theatre educator and has spent his life in Carrara. He says he mounts his resistance to extractivism through cultural and political action.\nTogether with others, he co-founded Fuoriluogo, an independent cultural group that produces satire, music and counter-narratives, rejecting corporate values and promoting alternative visions for Carrara’s future.\nIt is part of a small creative scene that has taken root in Carrara. Some artists have come here from elsewhere in Italy, as well as from other European countries and even as far afield as China, to join this artistic renaissance.\nOthers have chosen to stay here after studying at the local Fine Arts Academy, drawn by the town’s ancient sculptural legacy and its peculiar mix of decay and enchantment.\nRosmunda moved to Carrara more than a decade ago to attend the Academy and never left. Today, she creates visual art in a studio next door to an old anarchist print shop. The autonomous print shop “La Cooperativa Tipolitografica”, which the space taken up by her studio was originally part of, was founded in 1974 as a place where the anarchist movement could publish its books, newspapers, posters, pamphlets and flyers.\nCarrara’s connection to anarchism began nearly 150 years ago, when anarchist ideals found fertile ground among the downtrodden workers in the marble quarries. Led by Alberto Meschi, Carrara’s quarrymen became the first in Italy to win a six-and-a-half-hour workday in the early 20th century. Anarchist circles and collectives emerged in nearly every town and neighbourhood across the Carrara region. In Gragnana, a village in the Apuan Alps, Italy’s oldest anarchist circle, “Errico Malatesta”, founded in 1885, still operates to this day.\n“I’m one of those who love this town and want it to thrive,” says Rosmunda, who believes the town has been hard-hit by years of austerity policies, introduced by the government following the global financial crisis of 2008, and underinvestment.\nOnly a small part of marble-extraction profits now flow back to the municipality, and Carrara and surrounding villages have been left with inadequate social housing, stripped-down health and childcare services and failing public transport.\n“It’s hard - there’s no social welfare, public services are falling apart,” Rosmunda says. “The wealth [from marble] stays in very few hands.”\nSculptor Chantal Stropeni adds: “Carrara is a paradox. There’s immense wealth - marble - and yet deep poverty, even among artists. To resist, we’ve formed a collective sculpture studio called Ponte di Ferro. There are 14 of us. We want to approach art differently - collectively. Carrara is a workshop: It’s easy to create here, but incredibly hard to see. The town is falling apart, and maybe that works in its favour: No one pays attention, no one asks questions.”\nIn the meantime, the mountains are disappearing - at a rate of 4 million to 5 million tonnes per year. The town is growing poorer. Automation has replaced many quarry jobs such as block cutting, drilling, splitting, chiselling and materials removal. Local jobs have dropped from 800 to about 600 in recent years.\nBut resistance in this region has a long legacy. “We’ve been fighting to reduce the impact of the extractive system - organising events, protests, talks and legal actions - for more than 30 years,” says Paola Antonioli, president of Legambiente Carrara, an Italian environmental nonprofit organisation. “Sure, the road is long. But something is shifting. Collective consciousness is beginning to awaken.”\nThis took on new strength in 2019 with the formation of Fridays for Future Carrara, which followed the example set by environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and holds protests on Fridays in the town.",

    "title": "Explosions, violations reported after India and Pakistan agree ceasefire",
    "text": "India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after days of military escalation, deadly cross-border attacks, accusations and counter accusations, had raised acute concerns that the two nuclear-armed neighbours would engage in an all-out war for the fifth time since 1947.\nBut violations of the truce were reported later on Saturday as explosions rang out across parts of Indian-administered Kashmir.\nIndia’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a briefing: “For the last few hours, there have been repeated violations of the understanding arrived at earlier this evening between the director generals of military operations of India and Pakistan”\n“This is a breach of an understanding arrived at earlier today … We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation,” he said.\nMisri added that India’s military has been given instructions to “deal strongly” with any violations.\nHowever, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry released a statement early Sunday responding to Misri’s comments, saying the country “remains committed to a faithful implementation of the ceasefire” announced with India earlier amid accusations of violations along the Line of Control (LoC).\nIn the statement, Pakistan accused India of committing breaches of the truce “in some areas”.\n“Notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas, our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint,” it said.\n“We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. The troops on the ground should also exercise restraint,” the statement added.\nPakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also told Geo News that there have been no violations of the agreement.\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Sahar Khan, a security analyst based in Washington, says the reported truce violations underscore just how tenuous peace along the LoC is. She noted the most recent fighting broke a ceasefire agreement reached in 2021, the most substantial since 2003.\n“This is still a very delicate and fragile ceasefire, but I think most people on the ground are relieved to see it,” Khan said. “The ceasefire agreement negotiated in 2021, which came into effect in 2023, was still really fragile. So I think while this is good news, I do expect to see some back and forth on this”, she added.\nEarlier Saturday, military officials from both countries had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 17:00 Indian time (11:30 GMT) on Saturday, bringing a halt to all firing and operations by land, air, and sea. This followed heavy overnight exchanges Friday into Saturday.\nMisri said earlier that the two military chiefs would speak to each other again on May 12.\nPakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said later on Saturday he believes the long-running dispute over Kashmir and water-sharing with India will be resolved. “For the benefit of everybody, we have made this agreement of ceasefire and we have been very positive about it,” he said in a televised address.\nSharif accused India of killing civilians and targeting mosques with drone and missile attacks in recent weeks, calling claims against Pakistan “baseless”.\n“If anyone challenges Pakistan’s independence,” Sharif warned. “We will do anything to defend it,” he added.\nThe ceasefire announcement met relief and joyous scenes from residents in both countries and in the areas of disputed Kashmir that each administers.\nBut just hours after the ceasefire was announced, explosions were heard across the city of Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir, according to Omar Abdullah, chief minister of the federal territory. “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar,” Abdullah posted on X.\nAl Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Lahore, Pakistan, said, “People are welcoming the ceasefire, but we are also reminded how precarious it is; ceasefire violations are already happening across the Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir region.”\n“We’ve been hearing from local sources that there has been an exchange of fire in multiple locations in the Kashmir region, and there are some projectiles that have entered the Pakistani airspace, as well”, he said.\n“We’re also hearing the loud explosions in Srinagar, similar to what was heard early Saturday and in the afternoon. Air sirens are all across, and there’s a power shutdown,” journalist Umar Mehraj told Al Jazeera from Srinagar.\n“I can see projectiles flying, projectiles in the sky. It’s very unclear if they are missiles or air defence intercepting these attacks. Similar reports of the explosions are being heard in Baramulla and Jammu,” said Mehraj.\nElectricity was cut off across multiple localities, adding to the confusion. With no official clarification on the nature of the blasts, some residents described feeling “abandoned and unprepared”.\n“One of the blasts was so powerful it made the walls tremble. Authorities are not clarifying what is going on; we do not have any shelters, nor did we hear any sirens. We do not know what to do. There is only fear,” one Srinagar resident told Al Jazeera.\nInternationally mediated\nThe ceasefire appears to have been mediated by international actors, but there are conflicting reports as to which countries played a crucial role.\nUS President Donald Trump claims it was the US – he was first to declare it on Truth Social post: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE”.\n“Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” he wrote.\nAl Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, noted, “There are questions about why the US did announce first. What sort of leverage does it have over India and Pakistan? We do know that it was a multilateral attempt to get a ceasefire. We do know, as well, that the United Kingdom has just signed a major trade deal with India, so it would also have great sway in this. Still, the US appears to be taking it further.”\nHowever, Dar told broadcaster Geo News that Pakistan and India had agreed to a “full-fledged” and “not partial” ceasefire, adding that three dozen countries were involved in the diplomacy that secured it.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agreement also includes plans for broader talks at a neutral venue, which conflicts with a statement published on social media by India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that says, “There is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.”\nBroader Issues\nAmid the cessation of hostilities, India and Pakistan have also agreed to a broader dialogue on various issues.\nTwo government sources told the news agency Reuters that all measures taken by India against Pakistan after April 22, including on trade and visas, remain in place.\nAl Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Lahore, Pakistan, said that for the Pakistani side, the water issue is crucial “because India has suspended its related treaty with Pakistan, which affects the livelihood and agriculture in this country”.\nFour government sources told Reuters that the Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan, remains suspended.\nThe treaty regulates the sharing of water from the Indus River and its tributaries between the South Asian nations. India pulled out of it last month. It is crucial to agriculture in both nations.\n“There are real fundamental political issues that need to be addressed so we don’t find ourselves again in a militarised crisis,” Elizabeth Threlkeld, director of the South Asia programme at the Stimson Centre, told Al Jazeera.\n“The timing is significant since there is significant water flow between India and Pakistan because of the season at the moment. But in a few months’ time, that will start to dry up,” she said.\nIndia does not necessarily have the infrastructure to meaningfully divert water right now, but it will gain that capacity when there’s less flow. So, that will have to be on the agenda of the talks if the two sides are to come together,” she added.\n‘God has been kind to us for now’\nFollowing the announcement of a ceasefire, residents on both sides of the Line of Control in Kashmir expressed a sense of relief, with many praying for a lasting solution to the Kashmir conflict.\n“I was extremely anxious about what was happening,” 25-year-old Rumaisa Jan, a resident of Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir who has her wedding scheduled next week, told Al Jazeera. “This is the wisest decision taken after so many lives have been lost. We want peace and an end to all these hostilities.”\nFirdous Ahmad Sheikh, who runs a travel agency in the city, said he was frustrated by Kashmir being turned into a “battleground” by the two countries.\n“My only fear is that things could escalate again in future. These countries must sit together and find a political solution to Kashmir once and for all. I pray our children don’t have to witness such times again.\n“God has been kind to us for now.”\nIn Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, residents welcomed the ceasefire, saying they hope it will bring long-awaited relief to a region that has borne the brunt of recurring conflict.\n“For us, peace means survival,” said Zulfikar Ali, a resident. “We’ve suffered enough. I’m glad that both Pakistan and India have made a sensible decision.”",

    "title": "Boy, 4, hospitalised after visit to farm in Cowbridge",
    "text": "Four-year-old boy hospitalised as 74 ill after petting farm trip\n7 hours ago\nCatriona Aitken\nBBC News\nThe parents of a four-year-old boy who became very unwell after a trip to a petting farm have described the \"nightmare\" of his symptoms developing while on holiday abroad.\nPublic health officials are examining 74 cases of cryptosporidium linked to visits to Cowbridge Farm Shop at Marlborough Grange Farm in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, during April.\nCryptosporidium is a parasite, often linked to contact with young farm animals, that can infect your bowels and cause an unpleasant and sometimes dangerous illness.\nPublic Health Wales (PHW) said 16 of those affected had been in hospital for at least one night.\nThe farm shop, which the BBC has approached for comment, has voluntarily suspended its feeding and petting sessions and is cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation, PHW said.\nGareth Carpenter and Kate Wiejak, from Bridgend, said their son Michael visited the farm on 11 April with his grandmother, Margaret Carpenter, while they packed for a family holiday.\nKate, 39, said: \"We go every single year, we love lamb petting, it's an amazing attraction for kids.\"\nKate said Margaret \"made sure\" Michael washed his hands afterwards, and also used hand sanitiser.\nThe following day, the family - including Kate's 16-year-old daughter and both of Michael's grandmothers - flew to Spain, renting a villa in Malaga with another family.\n\"We were looking forward to a nice holiday,\" said Gareth, adding they \"wouldn't dream\" of getting on the flight if there had been any sign of illness beforehand.\nBut by 14 April, Michael had begun to feel unwell, with a raised temperature and diarrhoea.\n\"We put it down to the food, or that he'd had too much sun as we'd been out by the pool for a couple of hours,\" said Gareth, 46.\n\"We thought, give him some sleep and a bit of Calpol and by the morning he'd be right as rain.\"\nBut Michael continued to be very unwell throughout the night and so, the following morning, they called the emergency medical services who advised them to take Michael to hospital.\nThey said \"luckily\" there was a private hospital just a five minutes' drive away.\nThe couple paid an €850 (£719) deposit to get Michael seen - €5,000 (£4,229) in total, later claimed back through their insurance - but said staff were \"absolutely amazing\" despite significant language barriers.\n\"We literally saw a doctor within 10 minutes, I was shocked,\" said Kate.\nDoctors said Michael had a serious infection and he spent three days in hospital.\n\"It was an absolute nightmare,\" said Kate.\nOn their return to Wales that weekend, which was a bank holiday, Michael still had a \"bad belly\" and so they took him to see a GP on 22 April, who requested a stool sample.\n\"We were driving ourselves crazy,\" said Gareth.\n\"We were thinking, was it a bit of chicken he ate, or an ice cream his Nana gave him - she was feeling terrible about that - or was it something in the water?\"\nGareth said he received a call from Public Health Wales the following day to say the test result had shown Michael was infected with cryptosporidium, and they asked him if Michael had been around any animals.\nWhen Gareth shared the details of the farm visit, he said he was told that there were a number of other cases of the infection linked to the same venue.\nBoth Kate and Gareth later became unwell with similar, but much milder, symptoms and Gareth said he was still experiencing stomach cramps, more than four weeks after Michael's contact with the animals.\nBut they said Michael had now made a full recovery, and no one else in their holiday party had contracted it.\nKate said Margaret \"blames herself\" for taking Michael to the farm, but said she wished \"more information\" had been given to people attending the petting sessions about the potential risks.\n\"It's only when something happens that you realise how serious it is,\" said Gareth.\n\"I would hate to see another parent go through the same thing.\"\nWhat is cryptosporidium?",

    "title": "Xi hails ‘confident’ China-Russia ties as Putin welcomes ‘dear friend’ to Kremlin",
    "text": "Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin exchanged warm words in the Kremlin on Thursday during a grand ceremony welcoming the Chinese leader for his 11th visit to Russia, ahead of a military parade to mark 80 years since the end of the second world war.\nAfter nearly four hours of talks, Xi described his meeting with his Russian counterpart as “in-depth, friendly and fruitful”.\nCalling Xi a “dear friend”, Putin said the talks were “warm and substantive” and ties between Russia and China were stronger than ever before.\nPutin announced plans to visit China in the autumn to mark the anniversary of Japan’s defeat in the second world war.\nThe two leaders presented a united front in opposition to a US-led global order they openly reject. Their display of solidarity comes as Donald Trump, the US president, wages a trade war against China and pushes Russia toward peace talks over Ukraine.\nIn a lengthy joint statement, they said they would deepen relations in all areas, including military ties, and “strengthen coordination in order to decisively counter Washington’s course of ‘dual containment’ of Russia and China”.\nAhead of the talks, Xi said: “History and reality have fully proven that the continued development and deepening of China-Russia relations is a natural continuation of the longstanding friendship between our peoples.”\nXi’s visit is a welcome boost for Putin at a time when his relationship with the Trump administration appears to be facing some turbulence.\nWhile Russia has expressed a desire to repair relations with the US, seeing potential for lucrative business deals, significant differences remain between the two countries over how to end the war in Ukraine. Moscow continues to stand by its maximalist demands, showing little willingness to compromise. Earlier this week, JD Vance, the US vice-president, said Russia was asking for “too much” in its negotiations with Ukraine, in the latest sign of mounting frustration in Washington.\nWorld leaders flying to Moscow for the Victory Day parade on Friday faced the threat of disruption from Ukrainian drone attacks, which forced most of the Russian capital’s airports to close on Wednesday. The flight of the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, was rerouted.\nSlovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico – the only EU leader to attend – was forced to take a circuitous route to Moscow on Thursday after Baltic nations closed their airspace to his flight. The detour means his jet is expected to fly over Hungary, Romania, the Black Sea, Georgia, and finally into Russia via Dagestan.\nOn Thursday, a three-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine declared by Russia came into effect, though Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of continuing hostilities.\nA Ukrainian military spokesperson reported Russian assaults along several points of the eastern front, while Moscow claimed Ukrainian forces had twice attempted to breach the border in its Kursk region.\n“Predictably, Putin’s ‘Parade ceasefire’ proves to be a farce,” wrote Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, on X.\n“According to our military data, despite Putin’s statements, Russian forces continue to attack across the entire frontline. From midnight to midday, Russia committed 734 ceasefire violations and 63 assault operations, 23 of which are ongoing,” Sybiha said. He added that Ukraine remained ready for “at least 30-day full ceasefire”.\nXi, whose plane was escorted by Russian fighter jets, was greeted on Wednesday by a military band playing the national anthems of Russia and China.\nIn an article published in Russian media, Xi said China and Russia had fought side by side in the second world war. “Today, 80 years later, unilateralism, hegemony and bullying are extremely harmful,” Xi wrote. “We must learn from history … [and] resolutely oppose all forms of hegemony and power politics, and jointly create a better future for mankind.”\nOn Thursday he said the world was facing “unilateralism and acts of hegemonic bullying in the international arena”, a veiled reference to the US-China trade war, in which China has accused the US of coercive behaviour.\nHopes in some Washington circles that the Trump administration might have been able to perform a “reverse Nixon” and persuade Russia to decouple from China by bolstering the US-Russia relationship appear to have failed with Xi and Putin’s declaration that their countries are closer than ever before.\nChina has been an economic lifeline for Russia during the war in Ukraine and Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China’s direct aiding of Moscow’s war effort.\nThe comments from Xi and Putin came a few hours after Lai Ching-te, the president of Taiwan, gave a speech in Taipei calling on European leaders to stand with Taiwan in the face of “a new totalitarian group”, a veiled reference to China and its allies. Lai compared Taiwan’s current predicament to that of European countries before the start of the second world war.\nXi has used this visit to underscore Russia’s support for China’s claims on Taiwan. “Russia has repeatedly reiterated that it adheres to the one-China principle, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence’, and firmly supports all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification,” Xi wrote on Wednesday.\nWestern leaders are increasingly worried that China could launch some form of assault on Taiwan in the next few years, with the war in Ukraine providing a template for how such an attack may play out on the world stage.\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "text": "Bruce Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, has celebrated their elder daughter’s birthday with a trip down memory lane.\nMabel Willis turned 11 on Sunday, and her proud mom marked the occasion by sharing a montage of family photos and videos taken over the years, set to the song “Pictures Of You” by The Cure.\n“Happy 11th Birthday Mabel Ray!” Heming Willis wrote in the caption.\n“Your energy is infectious,” she continued, praising her little girl for the way she “can light a whole room with your smile and warmth.”\n“How you love and care for your family and friends is beautiful to witness. Keep shining my love and always remember to #liveitup,” Heming Willis added.\nHeming Willis and Willis married in 2009. Along with Mabel, the couple also have an 8-year-old daughter, Evelyn. Willis also has daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah with his ex-wife, Demi Moore.\nWillis is clearly a doting dad. One picture in Heming Willis’ montage shows the “Die Hard” star holding baby Mabel while planting a kiss on her forehead, while a more recent image shows a beaming Willis hanging out in nature with his preteen.\nHeming Willis penned an equally heartfelt tribute last month when her husband celebrated his 68th birthday. Sharing a video montage on Instagram, she referred to the actor as “pure love.”\nIn February, Willis’ family announced that his speaking disorder, aphasia, had progressed into a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.\n“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,” they said in an update shared online. “As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”\nAccording to the Alzheimer’s Association, FTD refers to “a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brain’s frontal lobes (the areas behind your forehead) or its temporal lobes.” These areas of the brain are generally associated with personality, behavior and language.",

    "title": "Fi on the last great wave of British guitar bands",
    "text": "Why these 2000s indie heroes are back and bigger than ever\n3 days ago\nMark Savage\nMusic Correspondent\n\"I'm pretty sure we hung out in Brixton. Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself.\"\nLuke Pritchard, the eternally youthful lead singer of The Kooks, is reintroducing himself to fellow indie survivor and Hard-Fi frontman, Richard Archer.\nBoth admit the 2000s, when they each sold millions of records, are a bit of a blur.\n\"But I think I'd remember if you'd done something odd,\" reassures Archer, all chiselled good looks and friendly bonhomie.\n\"It's weird, because we were all part of the same scene but, when you're on tour, everyone's like planets, orbiting around but missing each other.\"\nThe Kooks and The 'Fi were at the epicentre of the last great indie boom – a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump.\nOver the next half-decade, they joined acts like Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight as they surfed a wave to the top of the charts.\nAngular riffs, clever-clever lyrics and big, hooky choruses were the order of the day.\nBy 2006, seven of the UK's 10 best-selling new albums were by guitar bands, including the Arctic Monkeys' incendiary debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and The Kooks' Inside In/Inside Out.\nBut the party couldn't last forever.\nIn 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase \"indie landfill\" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves.\nWhere were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called \"The Something\"?\nAlmost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal).\n\"It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,\" says Archer.\n\"The opportunities dried up in England,\" agrees Pritchard. \"We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more.\"\n\"It got to a point where we were just exhausted,\" Archer continues. \"It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things.\"\nIn the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld.\nBut when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes.\n\"The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,\" says Archer.\nThe show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album.\nThe Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences.\nBut today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Naïve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok.\nLater this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience.\nHow do they explain this sudden revival?\n\"We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,\" Pritchard observes.\n\"In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again.\"\nBut there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse.\n\"Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,\" agrees Pritchard. \"People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff.\n\"But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook.\"\nArcher recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for \"almost 365 days\".\nBut with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs.\n\"What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?\" says Archer.\nA shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry.\nThe Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 – making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies.\nStreams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up.\nThe only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise.\n\"We were never the best friends with the NME,\" laughs Archer.\n\"Who was?\" asks Pritchard. \"There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out.\"\nAre there any reviews seared into their memories?\n\"No, I've done a lot of work on that,\" Pritchard jokes. \"But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been.\"\n\"How can you not be, though?\" asks Archer. \"They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over.\"\nWhile compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music.\n\"I kept it,\" he says, \"so I could get revenge later.\"\n\"You should frame it and put it in the loo,\" Pritchard suggests.\n\"Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump.\"\nBut the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman.\nArcher, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world.\n\"I don't see the point in being just another indie band,\" he boasted in one interview. \"What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem.\"\n\"You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,\" Pritchard reflects now.\n\"But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging.\"\nWith hindsight, both men emerged from the 2000s relatively unscathed, and share a newfound appreciation for their early records.\nPritchard, in particular, is revisiting the breathless pop of The Kooks' first two albums on their new record Never/Know, released this week.\n\"I felt like I slightly lost my identity [because] I'd been collaborating with outside producers so much,\" he says.\n\"So I went back and played all the records we were listening to when we started - not to repeat ourselves, but to get a firm hand on the identity again.\"\nThe result is an album that's perfectly timed for summer road trips and sun-soaked festival sets, replete with buoyant melodies and timeless guitar grooves.\nArcher is in a similar place, with a new album inspired by a CD-Rom of old demos an ex-girlfriend sent to him last year.\nSo, have the bands got a five-year plan?\n\"Definitely - but it's locked up in my safe,\" laughs Pritchard. \"I think it's good to have goals!\"\n\"Do you really?\" asks Archer, with a concerned frown.\n\"I literally don't know what I'm going to have for lunch.\"",

    "text": "British plane parts are set to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the evolving trade agreement with Donald Trump’s administration, it has been reported.\nThe US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has said that engines from Rolls-Royce and similar plane parts would be able to enter the US market without tariffs, as part of a trade deal with the UK announced last week.\nHowever, there were no references to the exemption in a five-page document released in the aftermath of the deal’s announcement on Thursday setting out the terms of the “economic prosperity deal” and final details are still to be hammered out.\nThe UK businesses secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told the Sunday Times that the wider aerospace industry would have “a specific guarantee of zero tariffs” in the agreement.\nSuch a deal would provide certainty to a £40bn sector, which supports 450,000 jobs in the UK.\nThe deal would also be important to the US. Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners, and repair and maintenance facilities based in the US also require a regular flow of parts.\nLutnick said on Thursday that an unnamed UK company would buy Boeing planes worth $10bn (£7.5bn). On Friday, British Airways owner IAG confirmed it was buying the planes.\nThe hoped-for deal on aerospace trade comes after the US-UK deal offered relief to the car and steel industries, amid fears of hefty job losses.\nAlthough some of the terms are still unclear, the deal is likely to bring car tariffs down from 27.5% to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs to zero.\nPeter Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the US, said the agreement on UK car exports to the US had immediately prevented job losses at Jaguar Land Rover’s plant in the West Midlands.\nReynolds and the prime minister, Keir Starmer, have both indicated that the UK is also hoping to raise the quota on British-made cars beyond the initial 100,000 agreed as part of the final deal, as it threatens to act as a cap on exports.\nThe hoped-for aerospace agreement comes after the US kicked off an investigation on 1 May into whether imported aircraft, jet engines and parts represent a threat to national security.\nIts examination into the risks of “the concentration of US imports” on a small number of suppliers and the “the impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices” was expected to pave the way for higher tariffs.\nHowever, the aerospace and aviation industry has been lobbying the White House to retain a 45-year-old treaty that allowed aircraft and parts to largely be traded duty-free across borders.\nThe Department for Business and Trade has been approached for comment.",

    "title": "Kwame Brathwaite, photographer of ‘Black is Beautiful’ movement, dies at 85",
    "text": "Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Art Newspaper, an editorial partner of CNN Style.\nKwame Brathwaite, the pioneering activist and photographer whose work helped define the aesthetics of the “Black is Beautiful” movement of the 1960s and beyond, died on April 1, aged 85.\nHis son, Kwame Brathwaite, Jr, announced his father’s death in an Instagram post that read in part, “I am deeply saddened to share that my Baba, the patriarch of our family, our rock and my hero has transitioned.”\nBrathwaite’s work has been the subject of resurgent interest from curators, historians and collectors in recent years, and his first major institutional retrospective, which was organized by the Aperture Foundation, made its debut in 2019 at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles before touring the country.\nBrathwaite was born in 1938 to Barbadian immigrants, in what he referred to as “the People’s Republic of Brooklyn” in New York, though his family moved from there to Harlem and then to the South Bronx when Brathwaite was 5 years old. He attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) and, according to profiles of Brathwaite in T Magazine and Vice, was drawn to photography by two moments. The first was in August of 1955, when a 17-year-old Brathwaite encountered David Jackson’s haunting photograph of a brutalized Emmett Till in his open casket. The second was in 1956, when — after he and his brother Elombe co-founded the African Jazz Arts Society and Studios (AJASS) — Brathwaite saw a young man taking photos in a dark jazz club without the use of a flash, and his mind became alight with possibility.\nUsing a Hasselblad medium-format camera, Brathwaite attempted to do the same, learning to work with limited light in a manner that enhanced the visual narrative of his imagery. He would soon also develop a darkroom technique that enriched and deepened how Black skin would appear in his photography, honing the practice in a small darkroom in his Harlem apartment. Brathwaite went on to photograph jazz legends performing throughout the 1950s and ’60s, including Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and others.\n“You want to get the feeling, the mood that you’re experiencing when they’re playing,” Brathwaite told Aperture Magazine in 2017. “That’s the thing. You want to capture that.”\nBy the early 1960s, alongside the rest of AJASS, Brathwaite began using his photography and organizing prowess to consciously push back against whitewashed, Eurocentric beauty standards. The group came up with the concept of the Grandassa Models, young Black women whom Brathwaite would photograph, celebrating and accentuating their features. In 1962, AJASS organized “Naturally ’62”, a fashion show held in a Harlem club called the Purple Manor and featuring the models. The show would go on to be held regularly until 1992. In 1966, Brathwaite married his wife Sikolo, a Grandassa Model whom he had met on the street the year prior when he asked if he could take her portrait. The two remained married for the rest of Brathwaite’s life.\nBy the 1970s, Brathwaite’s focus on jazz shifted to other forms of popular Black music. In 1974, he traveled to Africa with the Jackson Five to document their tour, also photographing the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo that same year. Commissions in this era also saw Brathwaite photographing Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Bob Marley and other music legends.\nThroughout the ensuing decades, Brathwaite continued to explore and develop his mode of photography, all through the lens of the “Black is Beautiful” ethos. In 2016, Brathwaite joined the roster of Philip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles, and he was continuing to photograph commissions as recently as 2018, when he shot artist and stylist Joanne Petit-Frère for The New Yorker.\nT Magazine’s 2021 profile, published on the occasion of Brathwaite’s retrospective traveling to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, noted that the photographer’s health was failing such that he was unable to be interviewed for the article. A separate exhibition, “Kwame Brathwaite: Things Well Worth Waiting For,” is currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it will remain until July 24.\nTop image: Kwame Brathwaite, “Untitled (Sikolo Brathwaite, Orange Portrait),” 1968",

    "title": "Syrian refugee elected mayor of German town, years after fleeing war",
    "text": "A Syrian who arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2015 has won a mayoral election in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg.\nRyyan Alshebl, who left his hometown of As Suwayda in Syria eight years ago, ran as an independent in the municipality of Ostelsheim. He won 55.41% of the votes on Sunday, beating two German candidates, Marco Strauss and Mathias Fey.\nLocals cheered the 29-year-old when he welcomed his win, a victory he described as “sensational,” German local broadcaster SWR reported Monday.\n“Today, Ostelsheim sent an example for broad-mindedness and cosmopolitanism for the whole of Germany,” he said, according to to German public broadcaster ZDF. “That’s not something that can be taken for granted in a conservative, rural area.”\nAlshebl’s first call after his victory was to his mother in Syria, who was thrilled with the news, SWR reported.\nThe Association of Municipalities of Baden-Württemberg said Alshebl is the first man with Syrian roots to run for and win a mayor’s office. He will start his role in June.\nOstelsheim residents have welcomed their incoming mayor. “The fairy tale has come true, and the right man has become our mayor,” Annette Keck, who lives in the village, told SWR.\nStrauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook.\nThe state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said.\nNot everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail.\nThe young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF.\n‘Investing in your future’\nBorn to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website.\nAt the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from home by late 2015 – about half of Syria’s pre-war population.\nAlshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website.\nWhile many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy.\nFormer German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.\nThe move sparked a backlash in Germany and the sudden growth of the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the wake of summer 2015.\nOnce in Germany, Alshebl lived close to Ostelsheim and said at the time he felt “there is only one thing you can do: get back on your feet quickly and start investing in your own future quickly.”\nFor the last seven years he worked in the administration of Althengstett town hall, in a neighboring town. He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities. Flexible childcare and climate protections are also on his agenda.\nAlshebl, who is a member of the Green Party and now has German citizenship, pledged during his campaign that once elected as mayor he would move to Ostelsheim.",

    "title": "Opinion: ‘Until we meet again, brave little cat.’ The heartbreak and taboo of burying our pets",
    "text": "Editor’s Note: Eric Tourigny is a lecturer in historical archaeology at Newcastle University, UK. His research interprets osteological and material culture remains alongside historic texts to examine changing human-animal relationships in Europe and North America over the past 500 years. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\nWhy do we bury our departed loved ones in a cemetery? A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.\nBut what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?\nThe Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of the country’s first public pet cemetery. Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.\nFor me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where 50% of families own a pet.\nHow did a city that is home to 180,000 dogs not already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector, according to Barcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”\nAfter all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americas since the late 19th century. Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.\nA grave discovery\nI became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.\nThis dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.\nThis elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?\nThis, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.\nGood hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.\nThe most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.\nA member of the family\nLike the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.\nMy study of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britain from the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.\nBy the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”\nSociety’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”\nI wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona’s new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.\nOver time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing the co-burial of cremated animals and people, which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.\nModern mourning\nFor me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.\nThe connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.\nThe RSPCA reassures the public on its website that they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like the Blue Cross and Rainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Center offer counseling to bereaved humans.\nClose relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.\nAt an estimated cost of €200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.\nThis will not be a space for all of the city’s pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums and digital pet cemeteries also provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.\nWhether one chooses a pet cemetery or not, there are many acceptable ways to express your grief – and to remember your relationship with the important animals in your life.",

    "title": "Opinion: Why is ‘60 Minutes’ amplifying the views of Marjorie Taylor Greene?",
    "text": "Editor’s Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio’s daily program “The Dean Obeidallah Show.” Follow him @DeanObeidallah@masto.ai. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\nLast year, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke at a white nationalist event organized by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that caused Republican leaders to denounce her.\nLast week, Greene’s Twitter account was temporarily suspended by the Elon Musk-headed platform over a tweet with a graphic referring to a “Trans Day of Vengeance,” as she denounced a planned transgender rights rally.\nAnd come Tuesday, Greene has announced plans to protest in New York City when former President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned on an indictment of more than 30 counts, calling the proceedings against him an “unconstitutional WITCH HUNT!”\nBut on Sunday, Greene was featured on CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview the long-running show promoted on Twitter with the tease: “Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, nicknamed MTG, isn’t afraid to share her opinions, no matter how intense and in-your-face they are. She sits down with Lesley Stahl this Sunday on 60 Minutes.” The images attached to this tweet by “60 Minutes” include Greene and Stahl walking through the US Capitol, taking a stroll outside and Greene showing Stahl something on her phone.\nIn the segment that aired Sunday night, Stahl noted the congresswoman had moved from the fringe to the GOP’s front row in two years despite a “sharp tongue” and “some pretty radical views” as well as “over the top” comments such as “the Democrats are a party of pedophiles.” Stahl also referred to video of Greene chasing a Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor, still maintaining that the 2020 election was stolen and failing to criticize Trump over spending. (The interview was conducted before news of his indictment.)\nBut Stahl didn’t mention Greene spoke at a white nationalist event a year ago while a member of Congress or her extreme anti-Muslim views and her defense of January 6 rioters.\nCriticism of CBS for amplifying Greene has been swift and well-deserved even before the program aired. Former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted beforehand: “Wow. Insane that 60 min would do this.” (Kinzinger is a CNN senior political commentator.)\nJournalist Molly Jong-Fast also slammed “60 Minutes” with the tweet: “Attention is currency and 60 minutes is spending its currency on the Jewish space lasers woman.” (Jong-Fast was apparently referring to Greene’s past claim that a massive California wildfire was started by “a laser” beamed from space controlled by a prominent Jewish banking family.)\nDavid Hogg, who survived the 2018 horrific school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has since become an activist against gun violence, responded, “I look forward to your questions about why she thinks school shootings are fake and why she’s supported QAnon.”\nGreene amplified the conspiracy theory — two years before being elected to Congress — that the Parkland shooting that took 17 lives was staged. And in 2019, Greene appeared on video confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a “coward.” She also called Hogg “#littleHitler” on social media.\nGreene’s own tweet promoting Sunday’s segment was not filled with her typical smears of “fake news” when she doesn’t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised “60 Minutes” host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): “It was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.” Greene added, “Leslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism. And while we may disagree on some issues, I respect her greatly.”\nNow, it is true that “60 Minutes” over its 50-plus-year history has featured what the show has dubbed “controversial” guests. These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose 1995 terrorist attack left 168 dead, including 19 children. And the show did a 1979 interview with Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\nPerhaps “60 Minutes” views Greene — who has repeatedly downplayed and even defended the January 6, 2021, attack plus called for the GOP to become the party of “Christian nationalism” — in the vein of its long list of controversial guests. (CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.)\nHowever, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the comments of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” Moonves added, “The money’s rolling in and this is fun. … (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,” concluding, “Sorry. It’s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.”",

    "title": "Erdogan’s political fate may be determined by Turkey’s Kurds",
    "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\nTurkey’s persecuted pro-Kurdish party has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nIn a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival.\n“We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a statement on March 23. “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.”\nIt is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader Selahattin Demirtas has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics.\nThe HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media.\nKilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.\n“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”\nExperts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, an ethnic minority from which a separatist militant movement has emerged.\nThe party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.\nBut ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.\nKurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.\nIt is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.\nPrecarious position\nThe accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.\nIf the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.\nThe HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority.\n“They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament.\nThe HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation.\n“We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.”\nThe party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.”\nSomer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism.\nIts former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure.\nThe Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.\nA post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.”\nOzsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities.\n“We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.\nThe digest\nTwo women arrested for not wearing hijab following ‘yogurt attack’\nTwo women were arrested in Iran for failing to wear the hijab in public, after a man threw a tub of yogurt at them at a store in the city of Shandiz on Thursday, according to Mizan News Agency, the state-run outlet for Iran’s judiciary.\nOil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts\nOil prices spiked Monday after OPEC+ producers unexpectedly announced that they would cut output. Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 5.31% to $84.13 a barrel, while WTI, the US benchmark, rose 5.48% to $79.83. Both were the sharpest price rises in almost a year. The collective output cut by the nine members of OPEC+ totals 1.66 million barrels per day.\nIran blames Israel for the killing of second IRGC officer, vows to respond\nA second Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officer died following an attack in Syria on Friday, according to Iranian state media on Sunday. Iranian state media said the Iranian military adviser died after an Israeli attack near the Syrian capital Damascus left him wounded. The attack also killed another IRGC officer. In a tweet on Sunday, Iranian government spokesman Ali Bahadori Jahromi said the alleged Israeli attack wouldn’t go unanswered. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Sunday that Iran has the right to respond to “state terrorism.”\nWhat to watch\nIranian-American comedian Maz Jobrani, who has been touring the Middle East, spoke to CNN’s Becky Anderson about his support for the protests in his homeland, saying that he used his standup comedy platform to highlight the “brutality against the Iranian people.”\n“It was an opportunity for me to say, ‘let’s keep fighting,’” he said.\nWatch the interview here.\nTweet of the day\nAn Iranian state news outlet is gloating at what it sees as the demise of the US dollar.\nIRNA recreated a popular meme to mark China and Brazil’s decision to reportedly ditch the US dollar as an intermediary in trade, citing the Chinese state news outlet, China Daily. It shows two men representing China and Brazil posing in front of a grave labelled “USD.”\nThe meme was pinned to the top of IRNA’s Twitter page, and was met with laughter and ridicule. “Dream on,” said another user, pointing to the dollar’s use as the main reserve currency around the world.\nChina Daily said that the agreement was part of “the rising global use of the Chinese renminbi.” It would reportedly enable China and Brazil to conduct trade and financial transactions using local currencies instead of the dollar.",

    "title": "What OPEC’s surprise oil cut means for US gas prices",
    "text": "OPEC and its allies’ surprise move to slash oil production will soon be felt at US gas pumps.\nThe group known as OPEC+ announced Sunday it would cut oil production by more than 1.6 million barrels a day starting in May, running through the end of the year. The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday.\nThe production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.\n“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”\nThe national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.\n“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.\nThe average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a record $5.02 a gallon on June 14, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the average price fell every day. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline.\nEven at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nKloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.\n“They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said.",

    "title": "The $500 billion beauty industry’s ‘green’ ambitions are a patchwork at best. And they’re falling short",
    "text": "The escalating climate crisis is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal.\nStrategy and consulting firm Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021 found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.\nThis shift in consumer preferences has propelled many beauty brands to set environmental goals: to move away from single-use and virgin plastics, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.\nHowever, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.\nIngredient and branding transparency\nThere is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and “greenwashing,” where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated.\nCompanies often use marketing language like “clean beauty” to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.\n“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”\nIn a 2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change” their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”\n“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.\nJen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde — it claims to never use in its products.)\n“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”\n“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”\nMost makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”\nUnpacking plastics\nThe industry’s plastic packaging is a particular sustainability challenge — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.\nThe cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used 144,430 metric tons of plastic in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.\nAnd only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States only recycles 4% of its plastic waste.\nMany brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)\n“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.\nHowever, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.\nHair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.\n“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”\nThe weight of retail\nBeauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.\n“Smaller businesses do more, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”\nSephora launched its “Clean + Planet Positive” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.\nStill, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with.\nThe missing player\nThe gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born B Corporation, or B Corp. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among eco-conscious consumers, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.\nGovernments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.\nSusanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.\n“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.\nAnd when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency lists 2,495 substances banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration only lists 11, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied lab tests of 51 sunscreen products in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard.\nHowever, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.\n“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”\nIn the absence of bold regulations or global standards on sustainability practices, this “leadership” — undertaken both by brands and customers in the beauty marketplace — is likely to be the most immediately impactful vector for addressing the industry’s climate shortcomings. It will take continued collective advocacy and initiative to see meaningful climate-conscious change.",

    "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nCruising at a depth of 8,336 meters (over 27,000 feet) just above the seabed, a young snailfish has become the deepest fish ever filmed by scientists during a probe into the abyss of the northern Pacific Ocean.\nScientists from University of Western Australia and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology released footage of the snailfish on Sunday filmed last September by sea robots in deep trenches off Japan.\nAlong with the filming the deepest snailfish, the scientists physically caught two other specimens at 8,022 meters and set another record for the deepest catch.\nPreviously, the deepest snailfish ever spotted was at 7,703 meters in 2008, while scientists had never been able to collect fish from anywhere below 8,000 meters.\n“What is significant is that it shows how far a particular type of fish will descend in the ocean,” said marine biologist Alan Jamieson, founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre, who led the expedition.\nScientists are filming in the trenches off Japan as part of a 10-year study into the deepest fish populations in the world. Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.\nDuring the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.\nIn the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.\nJamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.\nAnother clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.\nImages of the two captured snailfish – identified as Pseudoliparis belyaevi – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.\nThey have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.\nThe professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.\nScientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.\n“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.",

    "title": "Chinese spy balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing",
    "text": "The Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.",

    "title": "Pinduoduo: One of China’s most popular apps has the ability to spy on its users, say experts",
    "text": "It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.\nBut according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.\nAnd once installed, it’s tough to remove.\nWhile many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.\nIn a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.\nMultiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.\n“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.\n“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”\nMalware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.\nEvidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.\nSome American lawmakers are pushing for a national ban on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew was grilled by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.\nThe revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is topping US download charts and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.\nWhile Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.\nThere is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, there are concerns from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities.\nThe findings follow Google’s suspension of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.\nAn ensuing report from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.\nPinduoduo has previously rejected “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”\nCNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.\nRise to success\nPinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and a market value three times that of eBay (EBAY), wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.\nFounded in 2015 in Shanghai by Colin Huang, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).\nIt succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.\nPinduoduo posted triple digit growth in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year it listed in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its earnings reports.\nIt was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.\nAccording to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.\n“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.\nBy collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.\nThis allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.\nThe team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.\nPDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.\nWhat experts found\nApproached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.\nGoogle Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.\nThe researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.\n“Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.\nThe app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.\nCheck Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.\nThe app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.\nThey also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.\n“Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.\nAndroid targeted\nIn China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the Android system. Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.\nSergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.\nCNN has reached out to these companies for comment.\nToshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.\n“I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.\nMost phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.\nToshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.\nPinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.\nAccording to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.\nOf the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.\nThey included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.\nDisbanding the team\nSuspicions about malware in Pinduoduo’s app were first raised in late February in a report by a Chinese cybersecurity firm called Dark Navy. Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with their own reports confirming the original findings.\nSoon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.\nTwo days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.\nThe next day, team members found themselves locked out of Pinduoduo’s bespoke workplace communication app, Knock, and lost access to files on the company’s internal network. Engineers also found their access to big data, data sheets and the log system revoked, the source said.\nMost of the team were transferred to work at Temu. They were assigned to different departments at the subsidiary, with some working on marketing or developing push notifications, according to the source.\nA core group of about 20 cybersecurity engineers who specialize in finding and exploiting vulnerabilities remain at Pinduoduo, they said.\nToshin of Oversecured, who looked into the update, said although the exploits were removed, the underlying code was still there and could be reactivated to carry out attacks.\nOversight failure\nPinduoduo has been able to grow its user base against a backdrop of the Chinese government’s regulatory clampdown on Big Tech that began in late 2020.\nThat year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a sweeping crackdown on apps that illegally collect and use personal data.\nIn 2021, Beijing passed its first comprehensive data privacy legislation.\nThe Personal Information Protection Law stipulates that no party should illegally collect, process or transmit personal information. They’re also banned from exploiting internet-related security vulnerabilities or engaging in actions that endanger cybersecurity.\nPinduoduo’s apparent malware would be a violation of those laws, tech policy experts say, and should have been detected by the regulator.\n“This would be embarrassing for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, because this is their job,” said Kendra Schaefer, a tech policy expert at Trivium China, a consultancy. “They’re supposed to check Pinduoduo, and the fact that they didn’t find (anything) is embarrassing for the regulator.”\nThe ministry has regularly published lists to name and shame apps found to have undermined user privacy or other rights. It also publishes a separate list of apps that are removed from app stores for failing to comply with regulations.\nPinduoduo did not appear on any of the lists.\nCNN has reached out to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China for comment.\nOn Chinese social media, some cybersecurity experts questioned why regulators haven’t taken any action.\n“Probably none of our regulators can understand coding and programming, nor do they understand technology. You can’t even understand the malicious code when it’s shoved right in front of your face,” a cybersecurity expert with 1.8 million followers wrote last week in a viral post on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform.\nThe post was censored the next day.",

    "title": "Inside haggis: The secrets of Scotland’s national dish",
    "text": "Anthony Bourdain loved haggis. But even the late, great American chef, writer and television host recognized that Scotland’s national dish, with its “sinister sheep parts” wrapped in a shroud of mystery and half-invented history, could be a hard sell.\n“Don’t let them tell you otherwise, that’s really one of life’s great pleasures,” Bourdain said on one of his gastro-curious pilgrimages to Glasgow. “There is no more unfairly reviled food on Earth than the haggis.”\nA mash-up of diced lung, liver and heart mixed with oatmeal, beef suet, onion and assorted spices, haggis was traditionally made by stuffing these raw ingredients into the stomach of a recently slain sheep and boiling the lot to a state of palatability.\nInstagrammable is not the word that immediately comes to mind. In our 21st-century world, where “clean” eating and processed pap overlap, haggis can seem like an “Outlander”-style outlier from another age.\nYet, by some alchemy, once cooked to its required “warm-reekin’ (steaming)” state, it adds up to much more than the sum of its modest parts. It’s offaly charm has kept nose-to-tail eating alive among a younger generation of Scots that has largely turned its back on the tripe, liver and kidneys their predecessors enjoyed (or endured).\nCarefully prepared, haggis tastes both oaty and meaty; it is dark and crumbly, a little crispy at the edges but still moist; earthy but also savory and spicy; deep-tasting and profoundly warming, the perfect foil for its traditional garnish of floury mashed potatoes and orange bashed turnip.\n“It’s like a cuddle for the stomach,” says Nicola Turner, a 35-year-old office administrator from Helensburgh, a town on western Scotland’s Firth of Clyde.\nSpice and texture\nFor children of the 1960s and ’70s, like crime novelist Ian Rankin, haggis meals were a choice between the classic meat-and-two-veg plate and the battered and deep-fried, chip-shop iteration loved by both his friend Bourdain and his quintessentially Scottish detective character, Inspector John Rebus.\nNow myriad other treatments have blossomed.\n“I’m pretty sure the first time I dined with AB in Edinburgh we had haggis in filo pastry with a jam-style – maybe blackcurrant – sauce,” Rankin recalled. “He was a big fan of haggis and of chip shops. Rebus will have enjoyed the occasional haggis supper from his local chip shop. He was definitely a fan, as am I.”\n“It is all about the spicing and the texture,” says the Scottish food writer, novelist and cook Sue Lawrence, a champion of haggis’ adaptability for use in other dishes. “If you didn’t know what was in it, you wouldn’t think ‘oh that tastes of liver or whatever.’ It is all nicely chopped up and the oatmeal gives it a lovely texture. It could easily be a nice, big mince dish.”\nLawrence uses haggis as an alternative to beef and pork ragù in lasagna and in her pastilla, a version of the North African dish in which a hand-made haggis from the Isle of Mull substitutes for the traditional poultry or seafood filling. The filo pastry savory is flavored with the spice blend ras el hanout, apricots, chile, orange zest and almonds before being sprinkled with cinnamon and icing sugar.\nSuch cultural crossovers serve as a reminder that haggis could easily be a dish with nothing specifically Scottish about it at all. Records of similar quick and portable preparations of the fast-perishing innards of sheep and other animals date back to ancient Rome and Greece.\nHaggis-like combinations of offal and grains are part of the culinary history of several countries. Spain has chireta, Romania drob and Sweden polsa, while chaudin, or ponce, is a rice and meat-stuffed pig stomach that is a staple of Cajun cooking.\nWild wee beastie\nIn neighboring England, recipes for “hagese,” “hagws of a schepe,” “haggas” or “haggus” pop up in recipe books published between the 15th and 17th centuries, probably preceding written records north of the border.\nEtymological evidence points to the term “haggis” having its roots in Old Norse, suggesting an early version of an oat-and-offal sausage might have arrived in Britain and Ireland on a Viking longboat.\nBut ever since it was first optioned by the poet Robert Burns in the late 1700s, the haggis backstory has been monopolized by Scotland and the Scots, sometimes mischievously.\nIt is, according to the kind of lore that Burns engendered, the dish a doughty Highlander would carry with him as he drove cattle through the glens to the markets of the central belt or the perfect picnic for a whisky smuggler plying his illicit trade by moonlight.\nFrom such romantic notions it was a short step to turning the haggis into a wee wild beastie, one with longer legs on one side that was thus condemned to run round and round whichever hill it lived on. In 2003, a poll of American tourists in Scotland found that one in three of them believed they might encounter such a confused creature on a Caledonian vacation.\nBourdain, a native New Yorker, may have qualified as haggis’ biggest admirer since Burns, but his compatriots at the US Department of Agriculture remain unconverted to offal-filled paunch. Haggis imports into the United States were prohibited in 1971 as part of a ban on the consumption of all livestock lungs. Authentic versions of old school haggis remain culinary contraband in the US, as hard to lay your hands on as Cuban cigars.\nAcross the rest of the world, it’s a different story. According to leading producer Simon Howie, haggis is more widely appreciated and consumed now than it has been since Burns improvised his “Address to a Haggis” for the entertainment of well-to-do Edinburgh acquaintances.\nPudding chieftan\nFirmly tongue-in-cheek, the poem lauds the “Great chieftain o’ the pudding race,” as exactly the kind of unpretentious, hearty fare required to nourish a nation of braveheart warriors.\nIn comparison to the enfeebling foreign muck enjoyed by the capital’s claret-quaffing elites of the time – the olio, fricassée or ragoût that would “sicken a sow” – Burns urges his readers to wonder at the magical impact of haggis on his fellow sons of Scotland’s soil.\nAs the English translation of the original Scots language version puts it:\nBut mark the Rustic, haggis-fed/\nThe trembling earth resounds his tread/\nClap in his ample fist a blade/\nHe’ll make it whistle/\nAnd legs and arms and heads will cut/\nOff like the heads of thistles\nThese days synthetic casings have largely replaced stomach but ovine and porcine innards remain at the core of most of the haggis produced in its homeland, said Howie, who estimates that his company Simon Howie Butchers, accounts for around 60% of the roughly two million haggises produced every year.\nFor Howie, versatility, value for money and convenience explain why this staple of the Scottish larder is thriving. Typically haggis retails in Scotland, which accounts for half of global consumption by volume, for around £6, or $7.70 per kilogram ($3.36/pound). That’s around half the price of less expensive cuts of beef or a third of the price of Scotch lamb while enjoying a fairly similar nutritional and calorific profile.\n“You can give your kids a meal that is not full of things you don’t want to feed them – for a few pounds you can feed three strapping lads,” Howie said.\n“From a kitchen perspective, it is very simple because when it leaves our factory it is already cooked. So when you or a restaurant owner gets it into the kitchen all you have to do is heat it up to be piping hot. It couldn’t be more basic: a student with no cooking skills or a Michelin-starred chef do exactly the same thing to put it out on the plate.”\nHaggis pakora\nIts texture means haggis can also be usefully deployed in fine dining alongside leaner meat like venison or as a stuffing for poultry and game birds. Its spicy intensity means it is also finding uses in canapés and as a crouton-borne garnish for soups.\nBuoyant sales are also underpinned by the increasing consumption of haggis in forms inspired by Scotland’s ethnic minorities.\nGlasgow’s Sikh community pioneered haggis pakora in the 1990s and samosas, spring rolls and quesadillas have followed in its wake, often using a vegetarian version of the protein in which the offal is replaced by a mix of vegetables, pulses and mushrooms.\nSuch dishes are more than culinary twists. They are badges of belonging, and an indication that, two centuries after Burns grabbed it for the nation, haggis is as intimately entwined with Scots identity as ever.\nJust ask Ross O’Cinneide, a promising 14-year-old fly-half in the junior section of Stirling County rugby club.\n“Most of my friends and I like haggis,” he says. “Mum makes it for us sometimes after rugby and it’s got a very nice warming feeling. And it’s nice because it’s purely Scottish.”",

    "title": "Micron Technology: China probes US chip maker for cybersecurity risks as tech tension escalates",
    "text": "China has launched a cybersecurity probe into Micron Technology, one of America’s largest memory chip makers, in apparent retaliation after US allies in Asia and Europe announced new restrictions on the sale of key technology to Beijing.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) will review products sold by Micron in the country, according to a statement by the watchdog late on Friday.\nThe move is aimed at “ensuring the security of key information infrastructure supply chains, preventing cybersecurity risks caused by hidden product problems, and maintaining national security,” it noted.\nIt came on the same day that Japan, a US ally, said it would restrict the export of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to countries including China, following similar moves by the United States and the Netherlands.\nWashington and its allies have announced curbs on China’s semiconductor industry, which strike at the heart of Beijing’s bid to become a tech superpower.\nLast month, the Netherlands also unveiled new restrictions on overseas sales of semiconductor technology, citing the need to protect national security. In October, the United States banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chipmaking equipment without a license.\nMicron told CNN it was aware of the review.\n“We are in communication with the CAC and are cooperating fully,” it said, adding that it stands by the security of its products. “Micron’s product shipments, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other functions are operating as normal.”\nRisks expected\nShares in Micron sank 4.4% on Wall Street Friday following the news, the biggest drop in more than three months. On Monday, they closed another 1.2% lower. Micron derives more than 10% of its revenue from China.\nIn an earlier filing, the Idaho-based company had warned of such risks.\n“The Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies,” it said last week.\nChina has strongly criticized restrictions on tech exports, saying last month it “firmly opposes” such measures.\nIn efforts to boost growth and job creation, Beijing is seeking to woo foreign investments as it grapples with mounting economic challenges. The newly minted premier Li Qiang and several top economic officials have been rolling out the welcome wagon for global CEOs and promising they would “provide a good environment and services.”\nBut Beijing has also exerted growing pressure on foreign companies to bring them into line with its agenda.\nLast month, authorities closed the Beijing office of Mintz Group, a US corporate intelligence firm, and detained five local staff.\nDays earlier, they suspended Deloitte’s operations in Beijing for three months and imposed a fine of $31 million over alleged lapses in its work auditing a state-owned distressed debt manager.",

    "title": "HSBC spinoff: Bank’s top execs face tense shareholders in Hong Kong calling for a breakup",
    "text": "HSBC’s top brass defended their strategy Monday to frustrated shareholders in the lender’s largest market, as Europe’s biggest bank continued to face calls to be split up.\nAt an informal shareholder meeting in Hong Kong, Chairman Mark Tucker and CEO Noel Quinn took questions from investors on issues ranging from how the bank was approaching demands for an overhaul of its business to its purchase of Silicon Valley Bank’s UK arm.\nIn prepared remarks, Tucker and Quinn each reiterated the board’s recommendation that shareholders vote against a resolution on the docket for its annual general meeting in May that would force the bank to come up with a plan to spin off or reorganize its Asian business — the lender’s main source of profits.\nTucker said the board was unanimous in its opposition to the resolution, stating plainly: “It would not be in your interest to split the bank.”\nHe said the board had previously reviewed a range of options for restructuring the bank, and concluded that such alternatives would “materially destroy value for shareholders,” including dividends.\n“Our strategy is working,” Tucker told the room of more than 1,000 shareholders. “Our current strategy is moving dividends up.”\nCalls for a breakup\nHSBC has been facing calls to separate its Asian business from the rest of the bank over the past year.\nShareholders in Hong Kong — where HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors’ portfolios — contend that the London-based lender’s performance has been dragged down by its businesses in other regions.\nQuinn addressed those complaints head-on Monday, saying “our profits in Hong Kong and the UK are no longer being dragged down by underperformance elsewhere. The group is performing well as a whole.”\nPressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss” because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.\nInvestors have also been unhappy with HSBC scrapping its dividend in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.\nChristine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.\n“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.\n“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”\nFong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender bringing back its dividend in 2021, albeit at a lower level.\nKen Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday.\nThe resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue.\nLui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.”\nHis group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added.\nThe Ping An question\nHSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder.\nPing An (PNGAY), China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure.\nIn a series of remarks made public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve HSBC’s performance and value.”\nSince then, the insurance giant’s views haven’t changed, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe source told CNN that Ping An has been calling for HSBC to explore a reorganization, with an eye on boosting its valuation and simplifying its regulatory obligations around the globe.\nThe insurer has not recommended a specific path forward but will support any initiatives, including a spinoff of its Asian business, that could boost its stock performance or value, the person added. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting.\nBanking sector turmoil\nHSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had scooped up the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded.\nCritics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together.\n“Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong.\nQuinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers. They pushed back on the notion that management hadn’t had time to carry out proper due diligence.\nTucker also weighed in on recent tumult in the banking industry, saying he did not expect an “immediate impact” on HSBC.\n“After the collapse of a number of smaller regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse, the share prices of all banks have been suppressed,” he noted.\nBut he said he did not believe such developments represented “a systemic risk” to the sector. “I do expect a period of uncertainty” before nerves settle, he added.",

    "title": "Britain’s pound is beating every other major currency this year",
    "text": "The British pound crashed to a record low last fall as investors rebelled against budget plans by former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.\nSterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.\nThe UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.\nThis resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.\nInflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.\nThe pound turnaround\nThe pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.\nThe International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.\n“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.\nBut the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.\n“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.\nThe euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.\nBoth currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.\nA lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.\nJordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.\n“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.",

    "title": "Irish broadcaster requests discussion over Israel’s Eurovision participation",
    "text": "Ireland’s public broadcaster has asked the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for a discussion about Israel’s inclusion in the Eurovision song contest, as 72 former contestants called for the Israeli broadcaster Kan to be banned from next week’s event in the Swiss city of Basel.\nThe director general of Ireland’s RTÉ, Kevin Bakhurst, said in a statement on Wednesday that he was “appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages”.\nBy asking for a discussion over Israel’s inclusion in Eurovision, Bakhurst said, he was mindful “of the need to maintain RTÉ’s objectivity in covering the war in Gaza”, as well as “severe political pressure” on Israel’s public service broadcaster Kan from the Israeli government.\nIsrael has been part of the world’s largest live music event since 1973, when it became the first participant not to be geographically located in Europe.\nThere were calls for Israel’s exclusion at last year’s event in the Swedish city of Malmö, and the Irish contestant Bambie Thug was asked by the EBU to remove Ogham script from their face and legs spelling out the words “Ceasefire” and “Freedom for Palestine”.\nAt this year’s contest, running from 13 to 17 May, Israel will be represented by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old singer who survived the Hamas massacre at the Nova music festival near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023. Hamas’s attacks on Israel that day killed 1,200 people and led to the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed more than 52,000 people.\nIn an open letter to the EBU this week, 72 musicians, lyricists and performers associated with the contest called for Kan’s exclusion, alleging the broadcaster was “complicit in Israel’s genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza and the decades-long regime of apartheid and military occupation against the entire Palestinian people”.\nA document linked to in the letter cites several incidents of Kan journalists allegedly endorsing military action or boasting about the destruction of Gaza as evidence of the broadcaster’s complicity.\nThe performers said Kan’s inclusion would “allow music to be used as a tool to whitewash crimes against humanity” and would amount to double standards since the EBU has banned Russia from the event since 2022 over its invasion of Ukraine.\nSignatories included former Eurovision winners such as Portugal’s Salvador Sobral and Fernando Tordo and Ireland’s Charlie McGettigan, as well as the British singer Mae Muller, France’s La Zarra, and last year’s competitors Ásdís of Iceland and Gåte of Norway.\nSix European foreign ministers – from Ireland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia and Spain – made a joint statement on Wednesday expressed their “grave concern about the reported Israeli plans to expand its military operations in Gaza and to establish a prolonged Israeli presence in the strip”.\nThe EBU has previously said none of its members had publicly opposed Kan’s participation in Eurovision.\nA spokesperson said in a subsequent statement: “We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. The EBU is not immune to global events but, together with our members, it is our role to ensure the contest remains, at its heart, a universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music.\n“We all aspire to keep the Eurovision song contest positive and inclusive and aspire to show the world as it could be, rather than how it necessarily is.”",

    "title": "Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk says she will continue to pursue her case",
    "text": "A Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University in the United States has returned to Boston after spending more than six weeks in an immigration detention centre in Louisiana in what her lawyers call a politically motivated crackdown on free speech.\nUpon arrival at Boston Logan International Airport, Rumeysa Ozturk told reporters on Saturday that she was excited to get back to her studies during what has been a “very difficult” period.\n“In the last 45 days, I lost both my freedom and also my education during a crucial time for my doctoral studies,” she said. “But I am so grateful for all the support, kindness and care.”\nA federal judge on Friday ordered her release pending a final decision on her claim that she was illegally detained.\nOzturk, 30, was detained on March 25 when immigration officials arrested her in Massachusetts, revoked her student visa and transferred her to the detention facility in Louisiana.\nSupporters believe Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar from Turkiye, was targeted for having co-written an opinion article in her student newspaper, calling on Tufts University to acknowledge Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide.\nA genocide case against Israel is under way at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accused Israel of committing genocide.\nOzturk was joined by her lawyers and two of Massachusetts’s Democratic members of Congress, Senator Edward Markey and Representative Ayanna Pressley.\n“Today is a tremendous day as we welcome you back, Rumeysa,” Markey said. “You have made millions and millions of people across our country so proud of the way you have fought.”\nOzturk’s lawyers say her visa was revoked without notice and she was not allowed to contact legal counsel for more than a day after her arrest.\nAppearing in court via video on Friday, Ozturk spoke of her deteriorating health, including severe asthma attacks in detention, and her hopes of continuing her doctoral research on children and social media.\nUS District Judge William Sessions granted Ozturk bail, saying she presented no flight risk or danger to the public. He found that her claim of unlawful detention raised serious constitutional questions, including potential violations of her rights to free speech and due process.\nOzturk’s case highlights a practice that has become common under President Donald Trump’s administration. Foreign students have been arrested and hundreds of their student visas revoked for their pro-Palestine views.\nMahmoud Khalil, who led the protests against Israel’s war on Gaza at Columbia University in New York, was among the first students detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 8. He remains in custody.\nThe Trump administration has been accused of conflating criticism of Israel as anti-Semitism.\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesperson previously accused Ozturk, without evidence, of supporting Hamas, which has been designated as a “terrorist” group by the US.\nOzturk denied any wrongdoing and said she will continue to pursue her case. “I have faith in the American system of justice,” she said.\nHer legal battle continues in Vermont while immigration hearings proceed separately in Louisiana, where she may participate remotely.\nVideos of her arrest, which show masked plainclothes officers taking her from a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Massachusetts, went viral and sent a chill across US university campuses.\nHer lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union argued that her arrest and detention were unlawfully designed to punish her for speech protected by the US Constitution’s First Amendment and to chill the speech of others.\nPressley, who with two other Democratic members of Congress from Massachusetts visited Ozturk while she was in custody, said she was held in “squalid, inhumane conditions” and denied proper medical care for worsening asthma attacks.\n“Rumeysa’s experience was not just an act of cruelty. It was a deliberate, coordinated attempt to intimidate, to instil fear, to send a chilling message to anyone who dares to speak out against injustice,” Pressley said.",
